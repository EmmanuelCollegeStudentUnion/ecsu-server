Whether you’re an experienced player looking to play in the college league, or just looking to play casually with your friends, we cater to players of all abilities. We meet weekly for casual games/training sessions, and also enter teams in the college league where we have traditionally had a strong record.

This year’s President is Ravi Mani (am2684). Join our Facebook group if you’re interested - we’re always happy to hear from new players interested in joining!
