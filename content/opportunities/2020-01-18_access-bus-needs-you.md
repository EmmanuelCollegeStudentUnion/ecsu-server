## ACCESS BUS NEEDS YOU!!!

Access Bus is one of the main outreach schemes that Emma runs throughout the year! It involves spending 2 days driving around Essex/Sheffield and giving talks at schools about what Oxbridge is like.

Each scheme will take place over 2 days in the week of the 23rd-27th of March (during Easter holidays) so please fill in this form if you're keen to help out!
Actual dates will be decided once I know when people are available.

[Volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o4GnOPeza8e416DnDEgCVZLpGgsIjmPz9uFK2bqVD-E/viewform?edit_requested=true)

We'll need around 8 people for each location, including 2 drivers for Essex and 1/2 for Sheffield.

FAQ for volunteers:
* I don't live locally: is this a problem?
    * Not at all! College pays for all food & travel costs, as well as paying for a hotel for volunteers to stay in
* Do I need to be from an Access background to help?
    * Nope, any and all help is very welcome :)

If you have any more questions please email me at access@ecsu.org.uk ðŸ¤©

Disclaimer: no actual buses are involved in the making of this outreach scheme
