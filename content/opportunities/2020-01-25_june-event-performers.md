We are Matteo and Yasmin, the Music Officers for Emma June Event 2020. 

We wanted to let you know that we are currently hiring student acts for 
June Event, and we'd love to have as many acts from Emma as possible!

All types of performance are welcome: bands, DJs, solo performers, etc. 
We've got a good range of opportunities available, so do get in touch 
with us if you're interested - simply send an email to 
music.emb84@gmail.com and we'll get back to you.

Hope to hear from some of you soon!

Cheers,
Matteo and Yasmin
