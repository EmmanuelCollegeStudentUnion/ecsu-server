      "Comment": "Great room as it's so large. Really nice big windows but I've rarely seen direct sunlight (through Michaelmas and Lent) as it's North facing. It is noisy when you hear the gate, and the common room noise can be quite annoying when trying to sleep. I have to wear earplugs which I don't mind but some people might. It's really nice to have a common room, there are often people in there working/chatting etc. It also means we don't have to invade anyone's space for socializing or celebrating. The kitchen is really handy, but very small which means that people other than from rooms 1, 2 and 3 don't tend to use it so not all bad (if a lot of people in the house are cooking sometimes you have to wait for a hotplate). Pretty sure most of the hotplates are working now though. Also there's 2 combi ovens in the whole house (not the nearby kitchen though).The room has been really cold with the cold weather. The window is really drafty so lets in loads of cold air, so I have sometimes kept my curtains closed all day just so I don't freeze.Would recommend this room, especially as it's only grade 2. A lot of people are surprised when they hear the grade just because it's so big. There's a bed, desk, large chest of drawers and cupboard, good shelf space, two coffee tables, desk chair + 2 arm chairs, fridge, no sink (don't need one with the kitchen next door)."

Large patio doors which are poorly insulated so I keep the curtains shut when I leave. Also not the best room if you're worried about security as it's on the ground floor but it faces the garden rather than the street. Toilet and sink right next door and kitchen round the corner which is only really used by rooms 1, 2 and 3. It's the closest room to the common room and by the stairs so it can get noisy. Great place to live, especially if you're good friends with the people in 1 and 2."

It is very small, but it does have a sink and is right next to a shower, toilet and kitchen. It's also really near the common room which is great, but far enough away that the noise isn't a problem. I would say the only problems are the size (it really is very small) and possibly the fact that quite a lot of people have to use the same shower. Overall not a terrible place to be if you're low down on the ballot, like I was. Also, just a correction, there is now wired internet and CUDN access."

      "Comment": "This room is clearly destined for those wallowing at the bottom of the ballot. It's tiny, has one less chair than the other rooms of what is indisputably the worst corridor of the house, and due to the wall-facing window natural light is rather limited. To continue the mould motif, there is none; however, they refurbed it last year and the new carpet has that sort of industrial chemical smell to it which isn't great. Advantages are that it's very near the toilet, stairs leading to the upper part of the house, shower (shared by far too many people due to uneven shower distribution in the house), kitchen and common room. Having said that, the walls are paper thin so pray you don't have a promiscuous neighbour: I once heard a phone go off next door and it was on vibrate.In conclusion, avoid this cave of a room if you can."

Has a sink, a nice big wardrobe, standard desk, shelves above desk (handy), standard bed, pin board, plenty of storage space - I can't really think of anything that's lacking. Toilet and shower are literally about 6 seconds walk away, kitchen is about 8 seconds and common room is about 10 seconds. The good thing about Blantyre is that most social stuff occurs in the common room, so you won't need a big room for entertaining guests. Not sure why"

If you're a poor sod at the bottom of the ballot like I was, choose 6,7,8 over 4,5 because they're nice and sunny and look out into the garden.Blantyre negatives: mainly small rooms, not in college, absolutely insane housekeeper.Blantyre positives: really great dining room and tv room area (great for dinner parties), combi ovens and hobs, laundry on site, not as far from the world as Barnwell, next to the gym and a supermarket, kebab shop, Domino's, noodle place...Basically, Blantyre's not great, but like everything, it's what you make of it. A group of ten of us all ended up here together and had a really fun time. So: don't make Blantyre your first choice, but don't kill yourself if you're forced to live here either...

Apart from that, the rooms not great- v small- 3 paces wide by 5 long- so no room to swing a cat once bed, desk, wardrobe, fridge & sink thrown in. Luckily, you don't have to spend all your time in there- Blantyre's got a common dining room & a tv room (with a tv and evreything), as well as probably some of the best kitchen facilities you'll get- combi-oven and hobs. So to stop claustrophobia setting in, get a group of you to live here & use the communal areas lots.There's also a laundry and housekeeper thrown in- one very useful, the other needs to be handled with care."

Also very close to the common room with sofas and a TV which is great for socialising, and almost makes up for the fact that the room is so small, but there is a fire door on the way which means you never hear noise from the common room. The walls are really thin which means you can hear pretty much everything which happens in the rooms either side though (6 and 8), but as long as you like the people you're living with it's fine! Really good wireless and wired connection, and the heating is great - when you turn the radiator up or down it actually changes the temperature of the room appropriately! Astounding. There's a nice view out to the garden as well (shown in a picture) so you can watch squirrels/cats/people getting their bikes all day long. The room is pretty much identical to 6 and 8, and the same layout as 4 and 5 which face a wall and not the garden. I got this from being pretty close to the bottom of the ballot, but I think you can do much worse for a grade 2."

Before coming to live in this room I was really worried about what it would be like but it's really grown on me - I rather like it.Blantyre in general is rather nice. There has been a bit of a reputation over the last few years of it being a \"mathmo-compsci-physical natsci house\" where no one really knows each other but this year that was not the case and it has been wonderful. If you can get a group of friends to live in Blantyre house then you will have a wonderful time!It's a reasonable length but not very wide - it's probably about as wide as three beds side by side and probably almost as long as 2 beds end on.The view is overlooking the garden which is nice. You have a sink. This is very near the common room so you can go there if you want to be social but the room is far enough away so as to not get noise if the common room is noisy.Toilets and showers are about 10 seconds away.This is probably not a room to go for if you like entertaining people but that being said you can easily get 4/5 in to watch a film.In summary - not your first choice of room but you could do considerably worse. Nice for a grade 2."

      "Comment": "This is a really great room, I love it! I would second everything said in the 2010 comment, and add that it's also nice and big. Currently it's only a grade 3, and you get so much for it - I reckon if it were in college it would be a grade 5 or 6.I would say the best thing about this room is the French doors - they let in a lot of light, they can let in/out air, they allow easy access to the bike sheds (particularly good in the morning lecture rush!), you can catch friends on their way in/out of the house (a good thing for me but probably not so good for them!), and they mean that if you lose your college card (which you need to get in through the front door to the whole house) you can still use your key to get into your room through the back (providing you haven't lost your key as well!). This last point is also good if you've got a friend staying who you have to split up with for some reason - one of you can take the key and the other the card, and both can access the room providing the front room door is left unlocked.Another thing to add is that it's got a really good radiator and the windows have a twisty lock (lots of the others in the house are the ones that you lift) so I haven't had a problem with being cold, and the windows don't rattle.I've found the main disadvantages to be the tiny kitchen and the almost-useless shower (it's more of a drizzle) - but my kind friends on the other side of the house let me use their kitchen and I always use the other showers (these are better than my shower at home!), so it's not too much of a problem :)Also the distance from college is a bit inconvenient, but on the whole I really don't mind it - it feels more relaxing because it's a bit further towards the edge of the Cambridge bubble, and the common room means that I still get to see most of my friends every day.On the whole I can highly recommend both Blantyre and this room, and I hope everything goes well for you if you're stressed out trying to decide where you want to live :) Libbie x"

      "Comment": "I would agree with all the good comments below! This room is a really good size for a grade 3 and the doors and window let a lot of sun in especially in the morning. The only thing about the patio doors is that the room can get cold unless you bolt them at the top and bottom - this is only a problem if you want to leave through them because you can't bolt them from the outside! But when it's warm outside it's lovely :) The doors are single-glazed (but don't rattle) and the other window is double-glazed. The radiator is fairly powerful so I haven't been cold (there was one time where it gave up and I froze slightly for two days but then it fixed itself). The room has pretty good furniture - big desk with lots of drawers, wardrobe, chest of drawers, three chairs, fridge table, bedside/coffee table, strange little footstool thing, bed, desk lamp. I would recommend bringing your own duvet though or another blanket because this one is pretty thin. No sink but the toilet and kitchen aren't far away. There are only two sockets behind the desk so I would recommend bringing a plug extension plank thing or rearranging the room (there are four more sockets elsewhere) so that you can plug the fridge, your laptop and the lamp in at the same time!The nearest kitchen is shared between a lot of people (7 I think?), but was manageable this year. It has a microwave and hotplates that actually get hot, no combi oven but there are two elsewhere in Blantyre. The shower is not great - the most annoying thing is that if you're the first one to use it in the morning it takes 5-10 minutes to warm up. But usable once it's warm! There are only 4 showers in Blantyre overall, which seems like very little but I've never had to wait for the shower (I don't have 9ams though).I think Blantyre is a lovely place to live, the distance from college is a little bit annoying if you just want to run up to print something or get a book out or get something from the vending machine, but otherwise it's fine! The common room is really nice for socializing or just eating/working in. The laundry is also really handy if you prefer to wash your own clothes and it surprisingly doesn't get too crowded!"

It's an OK size but there's no coffee table and only one extra chair so it's not that easy to entertain guests. I tend to keep my curtain shut since it's on the ground floor which makes it a little dark.

There is also an additional fridge table which I use as a coffee table. It has one of the new style, larger, square fridges which can be quite noisy but has a significantly larger capacity than the older ones. This room is quite small in comparison to other Blantyre grade 3 rooms but that's understandable given the ensuite and there's still enough room for most people. Though it is near a reasonably sized kitchen with hobs, it's also the kitchen used by the most people (Blantyre has 7 kitchens but this one is the nearest for 7 rooms) so it can get quite messy."

The view is not that bad (you can just about see some of Blantyre's back garden and spy on people as they go to get their bikes from the bike shed).

Furniture includes a bed, cupboard, desk, fridge on table, chest of drawers and two chairs. Pale green walls (painted this year) and blue/green carpet. Picture rail useful for hanging posters etc. During the day the room is very quiet although it can get quite noisy if there are a lot of people / loud music in the common room which is below.Blantyre in general is a fantastic place to live with plenty of bathrooms, kitchens, a common room / TV room, friendly housekeeper and only a 10 minute walk from college."

      "Comment": "Pretty decent for a grade 2, half of the window stares straight at a wall but you can still see some of the car space, grass and whatever (for anyone nosy you can see anyone coming and going on their bike too). The lamp is very bright but can effectively be dimmed by pointing it somewhere else... just be careful it doesn't fall off the desk because it's not very secure.You can often hear if people are still in the common room, especially if people are playing FIFA late at night. The noise didn't really bother me but if you're an early bird you might want to avoid that. Also the walls are pretty thin, so you can hear anything happening in the corridor and the room opposite (12). Birds can also be annoying early in the morning as the windows aren't very good. I had to stick wads of paper in the gaps to stop them rattling around when it was windy. The fridge is pretty small but I prefer it to a bigger fridge because it doesn't make any noise.The desk is easily big enough to work/eat on with enough drawers to store random stuff in like pads of paper and notes. There are a few shelves as well to store books/cereal/more random crap. The wardrobe is alright but it would be nicer if it was just a bit bigger. The closet is a good size for me but I don't really have much to hang so it might not be suitable for someone who relies on smart shirts and trousers all the time. Other furniture provided includes two chairs (one slightly higher for use at the desk, one slightly lower for chilling in if you ever have friends in (although given the room size that's probably unlikely) or maybe for reading in. I use it to store my dirty clothes. There's also a fridge table like in every room. The pin-board gets half-covered when the door's open which I assume would be annoying if anyone ever used the pin-board for much. The most annoying thing is the new mirror they installed because apparently everyone has to have one. While some rooms in Blantyre will have a reasonably-sized sink mirror or perhaps a floor-length wardrobe mirror, all room 11 now has is a rather pathetic head and shoulders mirror on the inside of the wardrobe. However the way the wardrobe opens means that you have to be awkwardly standing in a small square in the corner of the room to actually use said mirror (so usually you can't even see much because the light doesn't get there).The bed is standard 6'3'' size, there isn't room for a bigger bed if you need one and if you're any kind of tall you'll constantly hit your feet on the wardrobe (or the headboard). I made it more comfortable with a mattress-topper, I imagine it's not great without one, but most of the beds are the same anyway. It can be a bit creaky so if you choose to engage in wild lewd behaviour I suggest you go to their place. Also because the room across the corridor (12) will be able to hear everything going on.The wired internet is very good most of the time, the wireless not so much, but it's significantly better in this room than in the other parts of Blantyre, e.g. near the housekeeper it's pathetic and on the room 10 side of Blantyre you can actually get \"Uni of Cam\" with a slightly stronger signal than eduroam or EmmaBlantyre (still rubbish though).If you're a messy person, the room can feel a bit cramped sometimes, but it is more than adequate for a grade 2. The toilets/sink/bath (if you ever use the latter) are very close and two kitchens are reasonably close as well, including one of only two in Blantyre with a combi.In terms of temperature, the biggest difference is usually just whether or not the curtains are open. The windows can be a bit draughty in that respect, but I've never found the room particularly cold except when I'm up at about 3am rushing some work only wearing a t-shirt up top. I'm yet to experience summer in the room but given that the east is blocked by half of Blantyre I assume the room won't get too bright or hot.All in all it's pretty much what you'd expect from a grade 2, maybe slightly better. By far the worst thing about it is that it's in Blantyre which is so far away from everything (unless you're the kind of person who walks to lectures in which case you're probably fine). It can be nice to have a large group of people you know so close together though, even if it's slightly detrimental to work ethic (trust me on that one).Last comment: We recently got a flat-screen TV for the common room. Just saying."

Also right next to one of the better kitchens. Not having a sink isnt that much of an issue and the wireless connection (and wired) is great in this room. Not that much noise from the street as it isnt a busy road and you can see up both Gresham and Glisson roads from the desk (in the bay window) which is good if you like distractions, otherwise you might want to rearrange the room a bit. No directly neighbouring rooms (ie not sharing any walls) and can't seem to hear anything from above/below. Honestly cant think of any cons."

The bay window means lots of light and a great opportunity to people-watch, although it is easy to become distracted from work. Only a tiny bit of wall is shared with anybody, and there is an entirely pointless 1msquare entrance lobby (doubles as a changing room), which means noise levels are low. Probably one of the best rooms in Blantyre, even though others are higher grades. Only downsides are the distance to the showers and the lack of the sink, although the toilets are really close so the sink isn't really an issue. Blantyre is overall a great place to live, so definitely go for it if you can."

The common-room is just downstairs, which is good, but the doors can easily block out the sound if essays beckon. The window faces south-west, so for much of the day the sun makes the room light, but also very warm. In fact, the room heats up very easily in general for a reason which is persistently elusive: I have had the window open even in winter. The sink is a point in the room’s favour, despite the hot tap’s frequent seven- or eight- minute long refusals to dispense hot water (a problem in the whole extension). As has been mentioned, the wall on one side is thin enough to hear coughs, music and reactions to Middlesbrough matches, so some mutual sensitivity is required between neighbours. There is a sizeable wardrobe. The internet connection has recently been vastly improved (it is now on the College network). It is slightly larger than room no. 16 next door, but not as large as no. 15, and has not really enough space to entertain many guests. The various disadvantages are not catastrophic, however; this room is cosy and economical and I have been happy."

You can hear everything that's happening in room 16. If you live here, make sure you are good friends with your neighbour and be considerate so you stay that way. The walls really are that thin, we have conversations through them. Blantyre has many baths and three showers, which is a little bizzarre, but the kitchens are in general very good and the co-op is quite handy."

It is a nice working space and has a warm feel, a good choice for a grade 2."

If you are friendly with them it'll probably work out ok... otherwise you might want to invest an amp or some large speakers. That's what I did. The door to the rooom closes annoyingly slowly and during the day light comes in from the one window all day long. You might think this would be good... but it is too bright really and you have draw the curtains. The desk is very large and features wings, and the storage space is adequate. The internet in Blantyre is poor. Wireless and wired are provided but they are very variable in terms of being on. Blantyre is an 11 minute walk from college. Cooking facilities are limited."

For all the annoyance of the slope it adds character to the room and feels a lot less generic than your standard south court room.There is lots of storage space too, also, definitely bring a spare lamp/light it can get pretty dingy if you don't."

The Blantyre attic is a great hideaway for you and three friends, as long as they’re not too tall… The closest bathroom and kitchen are just down a flight of stairs but it’s a bit of a trek to the closest shower. Great value in my opinion for a grade one if you can get over the sloped ceilings and extra flight of stairs. "

Also, it's South facing which means its never too cold, and it's really cool being in the four attic rooms if you fill them out with your ballot group...All in all, I way prefer this to my Grade 5 South Court room of last year, but it's one you should definitely come and have a look at and see if you'd get on with it..."

Blantyre is a lovely place to live and has definitely helped me both work harder in the day as I stay in college and relax more in the evening. All of the attic gets a little hot sometimes so a small fan can be usefull. In addition it can be dark. The best light in the room by far is the desk lamp. If you bring a lamp and a fan though it is a truly great room. It's quiet enough to work when other people are having pres but also you can just go downstairs and find someone to talk to in the common room. I would thoroughly recommend taking all 4 attic rooms as a balloting group as it creates a lovely tiny community. You should probably be able to cycle so it doesn't even feel that far from college. It takes about 5 minutes to get to college and 12 to get to the sidgwick site. There are 2 shops nearby and both serve alcohol until 11 unlike little sainsbury's."

The lighting is pretty terrible, bring as many lamps as you can. There isn't very much storage room. There's no running water on the floor - but you are paying for a Grade 1."

Blantyre is now connected to the University data network (as of January 2012), and although people in the other side of the house seem to have problems with it, I haven't in this room, which means data speeds are fast, and comparable to rooms in college. There is a fairly big kitchen that is shared between rooms 22, 23 and 24, and has two hobs and a microwave. The room is next to the housekeeper, which is fine (except if you don't like hearing dogs barking late at night). There's less storage space than some of the smaller rooms in Blantyre (i.e. room 23), but it's fine because the room is so huge."

Despite the size of the room, it stays really warm in the winter. I guess the only disadvantages of this room is that the wired internet doesn't really work (the wireless signal is really strong though, so this doesn't really matter) and because it's next to the housekeeper, you can't really have big parties in here.

The curtains are good at keeping it dark enough to sleep in in the mornings, though. The downside of the windows is that they are single glazed, and it can get quite cold in winter if it's a grey day - bring a hot water bottle and obtain an extra blanket!The room is an interesting shape, which makes it seem more personal. I really like the layout, and you can move stuff around if you want. Large built in wardrobe with ample space - I converted half of mine into a pantry instead. Nice decoration, and close to a good sized kitchen with two hob rings and two microwaves in it (apparently we're not allowed a combi oven though). Furniture includes bed, desk, desk chair, comfy chair, chest of drawers, fridge on table, coffee table and built in wardrobe. There is a bathroom and shower/toilet room on the same floor which is handy, but there are two more showers downstairs which have much better water pressure. Laundry room also downstairs with a washing machine and dryer, although the dryer doesn't usually dry your clothes all the way. Next to the laundry room there's another kitchen which has a combi oven, which I've used a couple of times.I was warned that this room had the reputation of being the 'spider room', but I haven't seen any so far this year. I put conkers on the windowsills because apparently that discourages spiders. If you do get spiders, I heartily recommend this method. One last tip - this room is a favourite ladybird-hibernating location. If you open the windows during Michaelmas term, hordes of ladybirds will take up residence in the corners of your room over the winter. I personally didn't mind, but they tended to start dying all over the floor come January.Overall a really good room, with great value for money. It's a less than 5 minute cycle to college, so it's easy to go in for stuff. I didn't tend to use hall very much because the kitchen let me cook for myself and my friends much more than I could last year."

There's not much to add to what people have already written.The 2 huge windows are fantastic with lovely surroundings, bird song in the mornings and very low road noise. There's also loads of floor space, so it's great if you want to have a few friends over for dinner.Heating- previous occupants have said it's cold at night but I've found keeping the radiator on high keeps the room perfectly warm (even if the energy wastage is shameful). I'm quite aghast to hear that there have been \"juicy spider\" issues, as I have not come across any yet...(I'm nervous now). I can indeed vouch for the ladybird issue though - I had 200 this Michaelmas (yes, procrastination made me count them), which is fine if you're into nature but not so fine if you can't deal with them flying around your room while you sleep in November and slowly dying on your floor in January.One other downside, although quite clearly stated is that there is no sink/basin, which can be quite frustrating at times but having said that, the room is right next to the biggest and probably least busy kitchen in the house.This room is the perfect getaway from Cambridge's hecticness and great value for money (still at grade 3)."

      "Comment": "Fantastic room - loads of space for very little money, and the two huge windows make it feel even bigger. Plenty of sunlight which makes it a really nice place to work, especially in the evenings when lovely sunset colours come in through the smaller window. Loads of storage space except for the fridge, which can only fit about one meal's worth of food in - but with Tesco just down the road this isn't really a problem. Its also right next to the biggest kitchen in the house, and as I'm a rugby player I definitely appreciated having baths and a washing machine in the house. The showers are also far better than they were in my old room - good water pressure, even if lots of people using the water at once.Two points to bear in mind - the room is quite hard to heat in the winter, as it is single glazed with two external walls, so loses heat very quickly overnight but sunlight coming in through the windows heats it up a lot in the day. Basically it will be warm in the day time, then plummet overnight so it is cold in the mornings. The second point is that as mentioned above, the room does have its own ecosystem. Opening the windows in Michaelmas leads to an invasion of ladybirds from the colony outside, which seemed to survive pretty well for most of the term then started dying out in the last few weeks. This corrosponded with a number of large, well-fed looking spiders appearing. We are on freindly terms and they have been keeping me company throughout Lent term, but if you are not happy to offer lodgings to such guests this may not be the room for you.But overall: cheap, loads of space, lots of light, big kitchen, washing machine, baths and really not as far away as people think. Also super convenient if you are in the chemistry department a lot."

      "Comment": "This room is a nice size for a Grade 2: it's got plenty of wardrobe space and storage on top of it and under the bed. It has all the mod-cons: standard bed, newish fridge, desk, vaguely uncomfortable desk chair and another much comfier chair which is unfortunately too low for the desk. Being on the south-west side of the house, you are precariously positioned above the housekeeper, but I haven't found it a problem as the room's size isn't that well suited for socialising. You're also a long way from the common room, which is good for noise levels, but may be a drain on your social life. On the plus side, you're right next door to one of the kitchens, which is nice and big and only gets used by immediate neighbours on the corridor. There's also plenty of storage space in there for utensils if it gets too full in your room.The room faces the street so there's not much of a view and occasionally there's a bit of noise at night or early morning, but it's not been a problem for me. It also doesn't get much sun in the mornings or in midwinter, but there's usually a nice glow in the afternoon and the main light is good and bright once it's warmed up. The heating hasn't been a problem at all and even on the coldest nights you might find yourself too warm if the radiator is on full blast.As with all Blantyre rooms, you're a long way from college so handing in work in the small hours can be a drag, and unless you've got a friendly chef nearby or want to eat Domino's every night, you may have to cook regularly. I've found eating at hall for lunch means you can usually eat light in the evening, though.All in all, a very nice, comfortable room with few problems."

Obviously this depends on your neighbours - the room however is generally away from corridors/staircase/common room/roads which are potential sources of noise. Your get the nicest gyp room in the house to pretty much yourself and two others. Very spacious - enough to have wrestling matches, albeit very quiet ones as the housekeeper is just underneath. Huuuuge windows - let lots of light in! Asian not included. Only qualms are: too vast especially when you sometimes forget something on the other side of the room, study table chair sucks, study table leaches brown stuff when wet. Wifi connection is not great, but wired is ridiculously fast."

There's good shelving and wardrobe space, though the desk could be bigger. A downside is that the room is North-facing, so the natural light comes in mostly in the last hour of daylight.Living in Blantyre does mean getting used to slightly longer journeys to lectures (/supos/Hall/library/Cindies) or just being 5 min late to everything. Apart from that, it's a lovely place to live - very homely. The common room is fab (with a TV!), there a loads of kitchens and the distance from Hall means that many people share cooking, and there are loads of baths. Clean, nice baths."

Bring a lamp for the living room and wear lots of socks as it gets a tad chilly. Blantyre itself is a fantastic place to live provided you know and like the other residents.

The luxury!) and kitchens are really clean, and big, and also there is wireless internet at Blantyre - I don't know why it says there isn't. I haven't had any problems with noise, but there is a bin lorry which comes a few times a week in the morning, which might wake up light sleepers. Still get rooms hoovered and bins emptied. And once you've done the walk a few times, Blantyre doesn't seem so far away! All in all, this is a really great room - probably only an option for people high up in the ballot!"

Relatively well-equipped, with a coffee table and easy chair that actually fit in the room. No basin, but this isn't a problem as two loos (one also has a suspiciously underused bathtub) are literally just outside the door, which is very convenient. One of the three kitchens of old East Court is also right downstairs. Also plenty of wall space for posters etc. The room faces out onto Parker street which means it isn't as quiet as the rooms on the other side of the building, but it's still not extremely noisy; personally have never had trouble sleeping, but might want to think about it only if you're a super light sleeper. Minor cons would include the wardrobe, which is annoyingly small for no apparent reason and kind of wobbly, and the small size of the fridge, though that goes for all of the building and there is actually a proper fridge in the kitchen. All in all, this is a rather nice room to go for in your second year;"

It is below sea level I believe meaning that there is very little natural light coming through the window (which only opens several inches meaning ventilation is not the best). It's a good size for a grade two and actually one of the bigger rooms in East Court. It has a bookshelf, wardrobe, desk, chest of drawers and a mantelpiece so you are well equipped! If the heating is on its like a sauna, if its not its freezing. The room is very near to a toilet and the showers and also next door to a kitchen with a microwave and hobbs which is very sociable. It is also right next to the entrance to the building. The ceilings are low, however, and I have frequently rammed by skull against the doorframe. The staircase down to the room is very narrow as well. Common to all the East Court rooms is the \"VERY talkative\" bedder (to quote the tactful 2012 comment on this room) which is more of an issue to this room because of its close proximity to the kitchen. It is cheap and you get what you pay for but I am content."

The proximity to hall is fantastic - no excuses for missing meals, and it's perfectly central within college for visiting n/s court and hostel.The main downside is the noise. At the weekend you need to be a heavy sleeper as Revs and Spoons are within view of the window and it can get very noisy. And during the day you'll need to get used to the regular 2 minute beeping from the crossing. There are outer and inner windows, but at the moment both don't quite shut properly, so the noise is not as muted as it could be.But if you don't mind the noise (and like me can sleep through anything) then it's a lovely room - high ceilings and sink. And 2 toilets and 1 shower between the four rooms. And one last thing, the shower is not hot. It is at best lukewarm, and there's nothing maintenance can do, so if that's of great importance I would look elsewhere!"

The room is small for a grade 4, but it is so handily situated.Only bad things are that the gyp room is a cupboard with a microwave and a sink and the shower is tepid and has been all year despite complaining."

Shower has been largely cold all year, but is now apparently fixed, I'm not convinced and am continuing to use other ones. Ridiculously convenient for lectures, post room, hall and freepos machine.Window only lets in light in the morning- thus all my plants have died.Lots of storage space- the wardrobe is huge. In fact I'm fairly sure several people could fit inside it.You can also hear the cries of \"SPEEECH!\" after formal hall, which can be genuinely entertaining."

Toilets and shower all in good working order. See all the other benefits in the previous comments.Minor gripes are: - Single window means limited natural light during over the day - Can hear noise from hall and musical events in the Old Library (never been a problem though) - Can be relatively isolated if you don't know others in the 4 room flat- Quite a lot of stairs on the way up (only an issue if suffering from mobility problems)- Do get some tourists accidentally walking up the stairs (but there is a lockable door into the flat to prevent this.)Despite these very small things, this is a brilliant room, particularly when avoiding the distractions that can come from a large staircase."

      "Comment": "H1aRoom H1a might not have a basin but it really is very close to the ground floor toilet and kitchen - if you could call the palatial room furnished with a lonely double hob a kitchen. For those who have particular urges to urinate/vomit in sinks after a night on the lash there is the enviable choice between those offered in the kitchen or the toilet. The place is generally very warm as the radiator provides a strong current from six a.m. until closing time. At night it can become a little cool due to the single-glazed windows, so shut the curtains to preserve that warmth. Sometimes the door wobbles slightly when people swing the staircase door. This creates an irritating anonymous knocking, but ensuring that the outer door to the lounge as Senem and I liked to refer to it is closed solves this minor nuisance. A southern exposure fills the room with a sense of light and spaciousness, though late-afternoon sun, particularly in the winter, can distract and dazzle a reader at the desk. The view from the large, wooden, paned windows is over a small car park and the paddock towards Old Court. An observant occupant can use this fantastic vantage point to chose to be in, or out, when visitors arrive. The single bed is tucked into a tidy alcove in the room - this helps create a immediate sense of space when a guest enters the room, but may prove uncomfortable for the very tall, or very active, sleeper. The main light in the room is a terrible low-wattage bulb giving disgusting, pallid, yellow light. In the evenings it is suggested that a number of lamps be used as an alternative. In addition to the movement of the door in the breeze the precious silence of the room is occasionally disturbed by singing on the paddock, presumably by the sounds of tennis during exam term, as well as any trampolining in adjacent and superjacent rooms. There are plenty of sockets but perhaps one coffee table too many. The built-in wardrobe might prove limiting for a devout fashionista. The painted Welsh dresser provides a fine conversational feature. Offers are invited in the region of grade three."

The rooms on this side of the building obviously receive less natural light than those facing the paddock, but I haven't found it too dark at all, even through the winter months. This whole side of the building was double glazed last Summer (2012) so the noise from the street isn't a problem at all - you can barely hear it. There's plenty of storage space (wardrobe, chest of drawers, wall unit with shelves and cupboards). The room has a sink and is handy in being right next to the loo on the ground floor of the staircase, so you don't have to pop down into the basement - good for laziness. H staircase has 3 kitchens - the top and bottom floor ones have hobs, and the middle floor kitchen has a combi oven."

It's also fairly light, despite being on the back of the building, it never feels dingy, and the new double-glazing keeps a lot of the heat in. Only negatives are it's a bit loud with the buses going past in the night, and the bedroom gets a bit cold because the only radiator is in the living room. There's a kitchen on the same floor with no hobs, but there are hobs upstairs and downstairs so it's not a problem at all. Basically, it's great, I wouldn't say the problems I mentioned were substantial and it's a really sociable place to live with 4 rooms looking onto a hallway and kitchen."

You have a sink which is super useful and the gyp room is super handy right next door. There's a sofa and 3 chairs in the room, so you definitely have enough space to host people.

But it does mean that you won't get blinded from floods of sun!The staircase toilet is on the ground floor, and the showers are in the basement.The kitchen is so-so. There is a working hob. But if you're planning to cook a dinner for twelve, it ain't happening...Good points:It's still a nice room. You will need some extra furniture (like your own pieces from home, lamps, etc.) to fill up the space.The wireless router is in the room! (So great WiFi!)The kitchen is on the same floor. There is a combi-oven on the floor below. You'll get the view of the Paddock from the kitchen, and the view of the houses on the back.Being on the top means that you do have a bit more privacy.Laundry...(need I say more?)I highly recommend this room!"

      "Comment": "The most important thing to note about the ground floor of J is that it is very much a working corridor; the Housekeeper has her office in J2, the laundry is downstairs and so is the main housekeeping office. This has some clear benefits, such as being first in line for the laundry (if you wake up early), but it can also make the room a bit noisy - it's directly above the washing machines (though you filter this out quickly) and the housekeeping staff arrive earlier in the morning than the average (non-boatie) student wakes up. On the subject of noise, the walls with 1a and the corridor are thin enough to hear conversations (as well as coughing etc) clearly, but the wall with 3 is thick. This can mean that the room sometimes gets noisy at night. My solution is ear plugs, which can be purchased relatively cheaply and in bulk online.Sitting at the desk to type a review biases it, because J1b has one of the best views in college, directly across the paddock. This can mean though that during the day the sun is often in your eyes as you work (the room being South facing), although I have not found this to be a huge problem. In terms of being light at night, opening the wardrobe door to its fullest extent mitigates this.As previous occupants have said, the storage is very good - a large wardrobe, a chest of draws and four large shelves. There is also a desk with draws (one lockable, but no sign of the key), a low coffee table, a small bedside table, two chairs and a fridge. The room is not large (with Hostel's high ceilings, it is actually taller than it is wide), but not really tiny either. The loo and gyp opposite and showers downstairs are also convenient."

Issues: the wall with 1a is thin... you get used to it though, headphones come in handy but it depends on your neighbour really. It is a great room for a grade 3, just the right amount of space and you don't have to walk up all those stairs to get to your room. Kitchen facilities are fine too, with showers downstairs in the basement and laundry beneath you (which is really useful as you can get your laundry in first on a Monday morning before the hoards get there meaning a quick turn around)."

There is a big fireplace and molding all around the walls. It's also bigger than J1a and b for the same price. The biggest issue I've had with the room has been the lack of storage space - rather than a wardrobe, there are just some racks built in around the fireplace. Instead of a chest and drawers, there are two small cupboards, and two small sets of shelves. I found this a bit annoying, but I think it really depends how much stuff you have."

Essentially the same as all the other front facing sets, just a grade lower (and the same grade as the back-facing ones) because of the view I assume. Furniture is new and pretty decent, carpet and chairs could be less...brown... but apart from this very nice. Temperature control very good - there are nice hot pipes all the way along the skirting board on the front wall and a radiator, which I keep turned off because the pipes do so well.Only disadvantage is that the view and privacy aren't as good as the floors above because that hedge at the back of the paddock hides the car park in front of hostel, which has plenty of people walking through it.Hostel as a whole is brilliant, decent gyp room access and lovely bedders (this year at least) and have only had to wait once for a shower (total 5 showers and 5 toilets in the basement for the whole of H and J, and more toilets on other floors). Laundry is epic, and dropping it off on the way to the shower has the huge advantage of getting in there before anyone else in college, so it's often done before the end of the day!"

Heating's fine.View of New Court's nice. View out back might be a bit of an issue for some - there's a bus stop outside and although on the first floor, most of the buses are double decker so there are people outside your window most mornings. Can't hear them because the windows are good but they can see in when the curtains are open.[2011] : Oh and you have to clear all of your stuff out each holidays which is annoying, but there are two biggish cupboards you can leave stuff in, plus college storage. Oh and the kitchen comes with a toaster, kettle, microwave, etc"

Being in the top corner, this room doesn't get an awful lot of sun but you do get a good view over New Court and can see the top of chapel, which is nice. Also means you're above bus-level so don't have people looking into your bedroom at the back. Being on the corner nearest St. Andrews Street you do get occasional nighttime revelry noise, although it hasn't been that bad in my experience.The bedroom has a slightly strange diagonal wall situation going on, but this actually makes it a tiny bit bigger than others in New Court, so not much to complain about.Basically an extremely nice room, I've been very happy with it :)"

It really is like a flat, and my friends call it the 'country cottage' because it still has the original grate in the fireplace - its one of only two New Court sets, the other being N5, that does. Being on the top floor the ceilings are slightly lower but I actually prefer this - it makes the room more snug. Walls are freshly decorated in cream and there's a new carpet. Having your own bathroom is incredible, the shower is pretty powerful. The bedroom window overlooks Savinos and the double glazing means minimal noise from the buses. Having your own little cupboard kitchen off the bedroom is fantastic too and the extractor fan stops the bedroom stinking of food when you cook. Honestly, you have everything you need in this room and could easily never leave!! Great for entertaining too as the living room has lots of chairs and a sofa and everyone will want to come round. Small downsides: the rent is just over �100 per week, but if like me you were low in the ballot in 2nd year and paid very low rent, it balances out this year. You also have to move all your stuff out of the room outside of NPR because rooms are used for guests, but this is a minor price to pay for the best room in college!"

      "Comment": "My room in New Court this year is very spacious and well situated within college, and it's been really nice to have a separate bedroom and living room. However, it certainly has its downsides and I think when picking a room like this these are the most important to know about in order to balance this against the fact that this is an expensive room. Firstly, the windows are all single-glazed (and two of mine were broken during Term 1) so the rooms get very(!) cold. It's nice to have a kitchenette, but if you want to cook then the facilities won't be good enough - my room just has a standard microwave, and I've never used the college-provided kettle and toaster because both look like they're past their best. Therefore, this is definitely more of a room for someone who frequents hall. The space for hanging clothes is poor, but there is other storage space and shelves. I've been really lucky to have an en-suite for my second year, although the shower is pretty narrow and probably in need of refurbishment. Also, be aware that the bedrooms look right over the bus station, so it's not atypical to hear them throughout the night (as well as the sound of people coming back from clubs at 1am); and if you like it to be very quiet, that you are next to the Old Library where music practices and events are held that can be very noisy, and whilst that hasn't really bothered me, I can see how it may bug some people. It's also worth noting that I've had to spend a term with the constant sound of maintenance work being done, which is a possibility if you live here and they need to refurb parts of rooms. Overall, I have liked living here and think I made a good choice, but you just have to be aware if picking the room that it's in a very old building so it often needs repair (the heating has stopped working before and I've had to have freezing cold showers during Winter) and is prone to maintenance problems."

It's a decent size and the shape is a bit unusual, but isn't massively detrimental and creates a 'bedroom area' under the eaves which is quite nice. It is on the top floor which means lots of stairs, and people don't come up often so is probably nicer if you are in a group in 2nd or 3rd year, especially with freshers living on the lower floors. The gyp room is pretty small, but does its job and the toilets and sinks are right next door, which can be quite noisy at first, but it isn't a massive problem. Overall, it's a really nice room, and has more of a corridor feel because it is linked with both Q and R staircases."

We have nice hobs and an extractor fan but sadly no combi-oven microwaves.The en-suites are great with cupboards and a built in sink with a side. The showers are pretty good as well but the hot water seems to be a bit hit and miss at night.Lots of plug sockets (10 or so) and wired internet connection as well as lots of shelving. Has a lockable cupboard to keep things in in between term time as everything else has to be taken out.It's not a great social or party space but it's a nice place to live. The New Court Sets are the same grade and probably better value for money (much better option for the social side but sometimes noisy or older) but I'm very happy here, especially as I was quite low in the ballot."

      "Comment": "I would seriously discourage people from choosing this room, or to my knowledge any of the other new north court cloisters rooms. There seems to be a maintenance department directly below the rooms which means more often than not either your sleep or work is disturbed by loud drilling and sawing which manages to vibrate through the walls as if the drilling is in the room (I'm having to put my fingers in my ears between typing this it's so loud)!Other disadvantages are that the rooms aren't very big, the hot water goes off somewhere between 10pm-12, the ones on this side look out over a car park so leaving your window open at night inevitably ends up with you being woken up at 6am by people coming or going and obviously it's not a particularly nice view, and the rooms are quite dark during the day so if you're working during the day you generally have to switch the desk lamp on to see properly. There are some advantages, there's a lovely kitchen with a hob which can be great for being sociable, the attached bathroom is nice and there's a huge storage cupboard. In my personal opinion having lived here for a year the advantages really do not outweigh the disadvantages, especially for being the most expensive rooms in college."

I lived in Q16, a room with windows within about 10 metres of cl15, in 2011-2012 and yes there was a fair amount of noise from the workshop for the renovations as well as the alarms on the building opposite. However this year, 2013-2014, I am yet to hear them at all.However I will agree with the room being a little smaller than it's grade would lead on, however I would hardly call it small at all, you have a large wardrobe, chest of draws, good amount of shelf space and the ensuite, which is the main reason the room is small.You will be woken up by staff arriving in the morning if you leave your window open at night, but that isn't a huge issue really, and you can't hear anything with the windows shut thanks to it being a new room.So overall in my opinion I am very happy to have lived here, and yes it is a grade 7, but when it comes down to it, that isn't much more money than a grade 5 or 6 so definitely worth it."

The gyp room provides a good communal space for the corridor and is fitted out with hobs and a microwave/combi oven - these are popular, so sometimes you have to queue for them. There are two showers between seven, and three loos.Pros: Great view of North Court (esp. when sitting at the desk).Spacious, quite a lot of storage (walk in wardrobe as on the rest of T, lockable cupboard above it, dresser with plenty of shelf space, chest of drawers).Seating: Two armchairs and an office chair, as well as the windowsill/bench.Refurbished as of Lent 2015, so all of the fixtures and fittings in the gyp rooms and bathrooms are new.Cons: Noise from the staircase can be a little annoying at night, as this room is right next to the stairs, but closing the doors which link T01 & T02 to the rest of the staircase ameliorates this. No basin, but there is a loo just next door, so there is no real distance to go to get water.Key-card operated electrics, so people get locked out relatively often. NB: the single plug at the desk and the single plug to the right of it are not governed by the key card, and so can be used for a computer charger and the fridge.Only one gyp room on the ground floor, whereas the upper floors on T have two.The fireplace grate whistles, but if you cover it using a piece of A4 paper (held onto the metal with a small amount of blu-tack/sellotape) then the air-flow is blocked and the noise stops.

Not a huge amount of storage space for storage boxes and bags etc, but just about enough (under the bed and fridge table and shelves above the hangars in the wardrobe). It has a couple of sloping ceilings, which I think are cute. The room is on the top (3rd) floor of T and looks out on some apartments and an alley to the north of North Court (not the bus station, so not too noisy). My main problem with the room is the very small window, which is tucked away in a kind of corner between a wall and a sloping ceiling, so the room doesn't get much natural light - it is fine if you keep the light on all the time though.The room is right next to the toilets and shower and the bigger gyp room on this floor, so that's handy! The top floor of T has two gyp rooms but they're much smaller than the ones on the floor below and can get messy pretty quickly. The shower is v good (better than floor below) and the kitchen has hobs and a combi oven, so pretty good facilities :)Overall, very nice room and staircase because it's just been renovated - it is a little worse than the other grade 3s in North Court because of the small window, but it's probably too nice to be a grade 2"

Being at the top, there's plenty of stair climbing but also most of your view is over the park behind the bus station rather than the station itself"

Faces the bus station, but the new double glazing means you get used to the noise quite easily. A tree blocks out pretty much all the light except in winter, so you need the light on all the time. No sink in the room, but right next to a shower and toilet, both with sinks, and the shower is lovely and powerful. Big gyp room upstairs for the whole staircase with hobs and sinks."

      "Comment": "This room nice, especially having been recently refurbished (2011). It is a fairly reasonable size for a grade 3, and has a window seat, as well as one casual chair and desk chair. The storage is fairly good, but not in excess.The toilet and shower are on the same floor and shared between four so rarely have to wait. The bus station noise isn't too bad, the fridge is probably worse, but if you are really sensitive to noise you might want to avoid it. It does mean you can't open the windows without fumes/noise. You can hear the music student's room in Z, so that may or may not be a problem depending on the person. The lights and electricity are linked to your university card, which despite being extremely eco-friendly it is rather inconvenient sometimes...The heating works well, and you have a thermostatic radiator valve so can set the temperature to taste easily, however the landing is really cold in the winter as the radiator there is woefully undersized. The kitchen is on the floor above, but is well equipped and spacious. All in all a good room for its grade."

Recently painted, re-carpeted and re-curtained in greeny shades (not as bad as it sounds at all!!) On same floor as toilet and shower, bath is upstairs. Gyp room (..microwave room) is downstairs. Bus station view - not too noisy at all with double glazing - hardly notice it (though sunday mornings are a good time to air your room as the buses are way quieter on sundays!!) , might be stuffy in the summer (but i had a similar facing room last year and it was ok).Bad points: standardly bad cooking facilities as with all of north court. Person on the floor below will probably have a piano, but again this is the case in lots of north court rooms. THE DOOR AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS IF IT ISNT LATCHED. (not exactly a bad point...but its not great to be locked out your room at 3am when a bit drunk!). Great choice if u are low in the ballot and happy to live in college."

Kitchen is just across the landing - well equiped with four hobs. No combi oven though unfortunately!Nicest room in Y staircase I would say - Y5 is the mirror image of it.

The room is double glazed which cuts out almost all of the noise, and also keeps the room quite warm.The room is a quite big and is very close to the shower/toilet. Unfortunately this means you can hear the flush (and the refill), which is quite loud, and lasts over a minute. This can get quite annoying. The room also doesn't get any light.Overall, it's not too bad for a grade 3, but I'd recommend going for an inward facing room if possible. If you get this room, invest in some ear plugs.

      "Comment": "Really decent sized room for a Grade 2. It's the smallest room in the staircase but has definitely been big enough for me this year, and just has a cosy feel to it. I've had two friends stay round and they both managed to sleep at the same time on the floor and reckoned they could have fit another friend in too! (Although a later friend who visited didn't understand how two people had managed to sleep on the floor as she thought there wasn't much space...)The desk is shorter than most people's, which might be a downside if you like to spread out papers when working, and the windows aren't that big and are in a really inconvenient place to reach (above the desk and side table so you have to lean over everything and struggle with the old fashioned window closing mechanism). The windows don't seem to let in all that much natural light so I normally have the main lights all on. The only good thing about the windows is that from most angles in the room, all you can see is the sky, so no one can really see in from the street if you don't draw your curtains.It faces onto the bus station so there is definitely street noise but that never bothered me much when trying to sleep (I'm quite a heavy sleeper and if I'm tired I'll just fall asleep immediately, but if you're a light sleeper you might want to go elsewhere). You can hear people talking/laughing in the neighbouring rooms, but I think the walls are reasonably thick so its not normally that bad.Temperature control in the room is great. Shower and toilet facilities are decent. For some reason, the top floor (where this room is) has a tiny toilet room and shower room. As you progress down the floors, the shower/sink rooms get bigger, so if it bothers you, you can just use the shower facilities downstairs which are nicer."

Hobs and kitchen are really nice. Apart from lack of combination oven which I'm trying to sort out. Showers and toilets are brilliant with one between three people. Noise is ok. The bus station gives some noise but its never disturbed me since the soundproofing is very good.

It is on the first floor not the ground as listed so people can't look in as they walk around NC. It can be a little noisy as the room below is a piano room and there is no sound insulation between floors but, that will depend on who lives there and when you are in your room etc. It is well furnished - chest of drawers, dresser with shelving, fixed wardrobe, large desk, swivel desk chair, armchair, bed, bedside table, coffee table - all new and in good condition. Gyp room is slightly smaller than the one in Y but has two hobs that work well on every floor. Plenty of showers - I think 5 in total across the staircase and I haven't had any problems with them. The card accessed power is slightly annoying but it doesn't have the card activated locks that some of the newer staircases do. All in all pretty good. It is a higher grade than the ones around it despite being the same, or very similar, size and comparable in terms of facilities. The light and lack of bus noise do make quite a bit of difference though."

It faces the bus station, which doesn't massively bother me, (except for the occasional bang of a bus crashing into the fence behind college!) - but is very noticeable as soon as any windows are open, and would probably disrupt light sleepers. Kitchen facilities are 2 hobs per floor of 6 people - never particularly have any problems using them - though it would be nice to have a combi oven, not just a microwave. On the floor, theres 1 shower room, 1 toilet and 1 shower/toilet. Between 6 again, I've only ever had to wander up/downstairs once or twice. Bedder is very nice and happy to be flexible on when your room is cleaned - she keeps the kitchen very tidy, which is normally very good, although occasionally results in stuff migrating to a box on the landing!Furniture wise, it's standard. Bed. Office Chair (Swivels, but low back, so not great!), bedside table - 3 large drawers, built in wardrobe (decent size, not massive though), good above desk shelves and a big cupboard. Heating is excellent - hasn't ever broken, and is adjustable to various points between \"Arctic\" and \"Sauna\".Overally a very nice room, especially if you can stand the noise, or have some fascination with buses? There are some better value rooms around - Y5/6 are slightly bigger (I lived there first year) and are same grade, despite being courtyard facing. I'd also suggest the Y kitchens are better than those on Z, Although Z staircase is bigger (You have two Fellows up top, so I think 14 rooms are available vs 7/8 in Y.) Oh, and the intercoms let you speak to people, but only occasionally actually let them into your staircase, so trips to the bottom of the staircase become a fairly regular occurence!"

Being on the ground floor is great in that don't have to trek up and down the stupidly steep old court steps and it's probably a bit less noisy, you can also climb in and out of the windows easily which is fun. That said, other people can also climb in and out of the windows easily and being on the ground floor feels like a bit of a security risk, especially as every one can see into the living from the paddock. Both rooms are quite large, the chapman's garden facing room is longer and narrower and quite shady but a lot more private, the paddock facing room is lovely but like a goldfish bowl, so you might end up having to draw the curtains 24/7 anyway. I reckon the chapman's garden side is better, especially as there's a box ledge (with hot water pipes underneath, which make it nice and toasty) next to the bed at exactly the right height, so you essentially have quite a bit more bed space, but it's pretty gloomy, and the apparent privacy can be deceptive. Both rooms have quite a bit of storage space, comes with table and chairs, the college standard two seater sofa etc. To be honest the whole place could do with re-plastering and re-painting, as occasionally we've found random chunks of masonry on the floor - once tried to move a poster and a (smallish) chunk of wall came away with it. That said it's probably looking considerably better than previous years, the poor abused room has had a rest year. And they deep clean the carpets. They said we were getting toilets and showers.. we're still waiting, maybe it'll happen for you. Downsides? Lots of people telling you how they've chundered all over your room."

And if you choose the right person, it really is loads of fun sharing a set. Being close to Front Court and being ground floor does make you wary of security more but as long as you do remember to lock your windows before you leave then you'll (probably) be fine. You will get tourists peeking in through the main window but I've never found it a problem and you can close the curtains after all.Both bedrooms can get rather a lot of noise (from Spoons or just people walking past on Paddock side). One of the biggest old court sets though, and really good bedroom sizes for both people.If you're even considering Old Court you're probably aware of the loo/shower situation but then by next year you may well have loos and showers in Old Court anyway..."

The room looks like it's been redecorated recently, so the walls are actually nice without big flakes of paint missing. Lots of sunshine through the day, although it can be a bit noisy from Spoons on Fri and Sat. Ceilings are a bit thin too... but overall a really nice set, and the trek to the loos isn't that bad once you get used to it!"

Not very slopey, will be right by the showers and toilets when they're installed next year (however there might be extra noise from that, you might want to check that). Very central in college and perfect for having friends round. Very little noise apart from when people are coming out the bar. Very large bedrooms and no flakey paint. Bring plenty of posters and lamps and lots of extension cords as no old court rooms have enough plug sockets."

      "Comment": "Thin walls, but this doesn't tend to be a problem if you're only noisy in the living room. Gigantic room. One plug socket in bedroom, two in living room, two in \"kitchen\" - bring extension leads. Sink in bedroom, takes ages to run hot water. Bigger fridge than in any other single room in college. The \"kitchen\" is about as big as a wardrobe, but quite a lot of storage space. Comes with a microwave, nobody seems to mind you having a kettle and toaster. Stairs are a bit scary when you're drunk and wearing heels, although this is probably partly why I haven't been portered despite loud parties.Furniture: one cabinet, one chest of drawers, one desk with drawers, one normal-sized wardrobe, a bed, two armchairs, two wooden chairs, a coffee table, a bedside table, a writing desk (works well as a food prep area). I advise bringing a lamp and a big rug to make the room less sparse, and maybe some cushions to use as extra seating, and a radiator key because the room is at the top of the college heating system so radiators need to be bled every fortnight or so. This may be a good thing come summer, when roaring heating isn't exactly desired.Two windows in each room, so gorgeous views over the paddock and chapman's garden. Not a huge amount of light, especially in the late afternoon/early evening.Internet connection is via wireless which is pretty temperamental.Toilets & showers being in South Court is a right pain, but the facilities are quite good when you actually make it down there. Best room I've ever had in college. Awesome party venue."

Heating is very good - it was always hot last term, even during the snow. \"Kitchen\" has a big fridge and a sink. Also, has the advantages of being in the middle of college and being very sociable.Down-sides: Main light is poor (so bring extra lighting), kitchen is small, no toilet means unless you are willing to use the sink it's an effort to trek to South Court/the library.

Park terrace is great because you have street access right around the corner from sainsbury's local but mainly everyone cuts through the garden straight into college and its very close to hostel for laundry. PT10 has not been renovated recently but its decent and there are 2 toilets, 1 shower and 1 very GYP room for 4 people.No sink in this room but many chairs, a huge double cupboard and a wardrobe for clothes plus plenty of shelves and a chimney. Ground floor means you can hear the front door slam when someone uses it and there is sometimes noise for parkers piece (some buses during the day) but shutters + the fact everyone uses the back door limits noise. Can sometimes through the wall if Room 3 is being extremely loud."

Great for hosting. A great view.Downsides: some noise from the road (buses stop not too late, but there's the occasional noisy car going by), rather rattly windows, and floor creaky in the middle. So don't go for this room if you're unable to work or sleep with quite a bit of noise going on. The current lighting can sometimes be a little dim-leave the main light on for a while before you're going to need it. People can sometimes see in, but there are shutters.No sink, but there is a wireless port contrary to what is currently on the site (it took a while to find-it's on the very bottom slot of the middle bookshelf).The house is bright inside, with oranges and reds."

Obviously it has less natural light than the rooms at the front, which look over Parkers Piece, but it's fine, and it's nice to have a view of the garden. Ceilings are really high so it feels very roomy. Good storage space, but no sink. The only real drawback with the house is that the kitchen is tiny - smaller than a South Court gyp room. It does have hobs, but no table like some other PT houses. This is because the whole second floor of the house has been converted into a fellow's flat, which also means there's only one bathroom (though with only four undergraduate rooms this isn't really a problem)."

I'm told the kitchen in the attic is one of the biggest in college, and it has a table and benches for you to sit at to eat. Bathroom now has a shower (hot water works fine), showerhead isn't too fantastic but still okay. PT13 is often used for guests and grads, so you may get people coming/moving in and out, but they're on the levels below and have their own toilet facilities. Lastly, soundproofing between rooms is quite good, so if your doors are closed it's hard to hear your neighbours!"

Having a sink is a bonus as well as being on the same floor as the toilet. Being at the front of the house can mean it's noisy as you can hear everyone going in/out but does also make the room sociable as people often pop in on their way to their room. One of the taps is very stiff and hard to turn off and there's a rather ominous crack in the wall...but apart from that this room has served me very well and really feels like a home! "

      "Comment": "It's a very nice and good-sized room for a grade 3. It can be a bit dark because it is in the basement but you do have your own door which is quite useful. 19 and 20 are connected through the basement so if you want to live out of college with a larger group of friends, this is the place. There is one gyp room and a kitchen both in the basement and shared between the 2 houses. They're both pretty rubbish but the kitchen does have hobs, a combi oven and a decent amount of space. Everything the person in 2009 said is still valid apart from the cat and the fact that 2009 is quite a long time ago now so calling the room recently decorated would be a lie. However everything is still in good condition and there are no chipped walls as is the case with some of the other rooms.Overall a nice room to live in if you decide to live out of college. Close access to kitchen and bathrooms and a sink in the room."

There is a toilet, shower and two kitchens (one of which has a hob and a dining table, shared with no. 19, which is great for having friends around) on the same floor (so it's a bit like a self-contained flat but even better!). There is also a cute cat which likes to visit from time to time (beware of letting it into your room though - it may refuse to leave!). Internet connection is wireless, which is pretty reliable on the whole - there have only been 2 occasions this year where it's gone a little haywire but it's always been sorted within a few hours. So on the whole, a really lovely room which I would greatly recommend!"

I absolutely adore this room, and I actually prefer it to my first year grade 6!!It's small, but cosy rather than pokey, particularly because the hot water tank is (hidden) in the corner - lovely and warm. It is in the basement and doesn't get the sun, but I've never found it too dark, possibly because the whole house was repainted in summer 2012. It also has great storage space - currently 3 shelves, a chest of drawers and a wardrobe. It really doesn't matter that I don't have a sink because I'm the only one on the 2 lower levels, so I have sole use of the \"communal sink\" which is about 3 metres from my room. The shower is also only shared with a handful of people.The house may not technically have a hob but everybody in 19 and 20 uses the hobs in 20 which are in the gyp room in the basement, so again, a few metres away. Currently, the gyp room in the basement of 19 has a combi oven anyway. In addition, 19 and 20 warkworth street have a back yard with our own bike racks, which is really important for security.Finally, YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY RENT FOR A GRADE 1!"

Close to both the kitchen and the bathroom and very nice olive branch themed curtains which compliment the magnolia hue of the walls. Only issue is rattling/drafty windows which and not very soundproof - raucous hooligans including the Anglia Ruskin football team can often be heard patrolling the streets in the early hours of the morning, but don't usually try to gain entry. Frequent road rage incidents occur outside the window which can be a good aid to procrastination. The nicest Warkworth house - overall 10/10 would recommend to a friend."

Decent size coffee table with 2 seat sofa and then another 2 single 'comfy' chairs. Also, standard desk and chair with lamp, fridge, small wardrobe, shelves and cupboards. There's a sink also. Only 1 heater but the room never gets too cold. Walls and carpet not in the most amazing condition but that's a really minor issue. Advice would be to bring loads and loads of posters/decorations otherwise it's so big that it starts to look bare!!The house has a really massive basement kitchen as well for group meals.

A bit of a trek to the kitchen (there's a little gyp room in the basement of 20 with microwaves, and a nice bigger kitchen in the basement of 19 with a hob), which means negotiating lots of doors and can be annoying when trying to cook in a rush/carry food between kitchen and room, but not a big problem. I really like the marble mantelpiece, and the recently-painted walls which with decoration make the room very cheerful. Being at the back of the house it doesn't get as much sunlight as other rooms, but again not a big problem at all. Overall brilliant for grade 3!"

Walls are quite thin but not a huge issue.Not in close proximity to a gyp room, there's one in the basement of Warkworth 20. Our basement is connected through to the basement of Warkworth 19 and so we share a communal kitchen, which is nice particularly if they're your friends.
