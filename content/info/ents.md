Emma Ents has been helping undergrads at Emma meet and socialise across subjects, years and even colleges since its conception, it's here to try and provide some spice to your college life. Our Ents Officers are always looking to organise something fun for Emma students. From DJ sets to comedy acts, pool tournaments to 5-a-side football; thereâ€™s always something going on!

In the past Emma Ents has hosted the Hip Hop society for an exhibition society, done a super ent with three other colleges and much, much more.

Emma Ents tries to cater to everyone with its wide variety of events, however if you feel like the Ents Officers could do something better or have any other ideas please drop them an email on: ents@ecsu.org.uk
