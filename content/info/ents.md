Emma Ents has been helping undergrads at Emma meet and socialise across subjects, years and even colleges since its conception, it's here to try and provide some spice to your college life. Our Ents coordinators are always looking to organise something fun for Emma students. From DJ sets to comedy acts, pool tournaments to 5-a-side football; thereâ€™s always something going on!

Emma Ents tries to cater to everyone with its wide variety of events, however if you feel like the Ents coordinators could do something better or have any other ideas please drop them an email on: ents@ecsu.org.uk
