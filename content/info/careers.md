Helping put you in touch with our extensive Emmanuel Alumni who are keen to help the future generations of Emmanuel graduates transition into the world of work.

## LinkedIn and the Alumni Database

We hold termly LinkedIn Brunches, where you can get advice on how to set up/ improve your profile. If you have a profile we would encourage you to join the
[Emmanuel Alumni Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?bout=&gid=152071).

Additionally, you can access the Emmanuel Alumni Database at: [Careers &amp; Networking | Members | Emmanuel College, Cambridge](https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/members/careers/)

All members of this group have agreed that they are happy to be contacted, please remember this is not the case for the linkedin group so any contact should take the form of a polite request for help, rather than a demand!
