## Who can apply for funding?

ECSU accepts funding applications from all clubs and societies which are run primarily or exclusively for current Emmanuel undergraduates. Both new and existing clubs may apply for funding.						

## When do I apply for funding?

Applications open at the beginning of Michaelmas and Lent term[^1], for a week.

## How do I apply?

Look out for an ECSU Committee FB post / email from the Treasurer.

## What information do I need?

You need to be able to provide: the official name of your society; at least two contacts; your name, position and CRSid; the society bank account and sort code; the current society bank balance; the total value you request; an itemised list of funding requests; approximate society membership and average regular attendance; and, for sports societies, confirmation that the bursar has approved your risk assessment. **If you don’t have a bank account** set up yet, please contact the Treasurer via [treasurer@ecsu.org.uk](mailto:treasurer@ecsu.org.uk).

## What does ECSU do with my application?

Once all applications have been received, then the allocation committee (the Treasurer, Vice-President and President of ECSU) meet to allocate funding. Once funding levels have been decided, the Treasurer will then contact all those who applied for funding, informing them how much funding they have received. Money should be in society bank accounts within a couple of weeks of the allocation committee meeting.

## How do ECSU decide how much to allocate to clubs and societies?

ECSU has around £6000 / year to allocate clubs and societies, but our funding request amount to around £12000 / year. To allocate scarce resources against multiple needs, the allocation committee use the following guidelines:						

> 
**ECSU will only fund societies if they fulfil the following criteria:**

* Regular meetings should be run throughout the term, if not the year; a continued existence in the summer term is preferable but seasonal considerations are of course understood.

* The society should be open to all Emmanuel undergraduates with the exception of gender specific sports[^2]. In the context of sports teams or musical groups, trials/auditions must be open to everyone even if only the best applicants are then chosen. 

* Societies should advertise their presence and actively look for more members, for example by running a stall at the freshers’ fair.

* The funding should be necessary for the running of the club.

* Curricular based societies are not funded.

* Academic societies must be accessible to all undergraduates, regardless of the course which they study.


**In addition:**

* The larger the society in terms of involvement the better.

* Past funding of societies will be considered.

* Societies with higher than average costs per person should not be surprised if their members are asked to provide a subscription.

* ECSU will meet essential needs (e.g. cuppers and league fees) before less essential needs (e.g. equipment, refreshments)



## What should I do if my club suddenly needs more money?

If the amounts allocated are not enough for your club to function or your club incurs unexpected costs or runs out of money, then please contact the Treasurer via [treasurer@ecsu.org.uk](mailto:treasurer@ecsu.org.uk).
