title: Rents
subtitle: Cost Information for accommodation in Emmanuel College
---

College has recently redesigned its rents system to provide greater certainty about the costs incurred whilst studying at Cambridge. These prices now include the Kitchen Fixed Charge which they didn't until now, which is partly why there has been an increase. These rents should increase by roughly 3% (in line with the RPI) each academic year. Undergraduates pay rent for 10 weeks per term.


Usually almost all of the rooms allocated to undergraduates are grades 1 to 5. College will ensure that, in the room balloting, the possibility of taking a room at a grade no higher than 5 is available to each student.


The College does not normally levy any additional charges in respect of the accommodation that it provides and the cost of laundry, cleaning, heating and lighting, basic contents insurance and the computer network is included within the rent figures set out below.


Please note that for graduate students commencing courses in 2017/18 the rent calculation will vary a little from that set out above. The rent charged on graduate rooms is also set on the basis of 8 grades but the rent varies with the distance of a graduate house from the main College site. The room rent for each grade of room occupied by a graduate student commencing his or her course in 2017/18 will, for the duration of that course, be linked to RPI in the manner outlined above.
