## Atmosphere

Emma is a friendly, lively college. Students here come from all over the country and the world. We have a really strong college spirit, where everyone goes out of the way to help and support each other.  Inter-year friendships and good feeling are fostered through our college and subject families systems, as well as college societies and parties in the bar. 

## Location and grounds

Emma has the perfect location. We're [central](http://map.cam.ac.uk/#/annotate/adapters/v4.json?mp=main;xx=2075;yy=910;mt=c;ms=180;sx=4;tl=Emmanuel%20College;gf=png), but occupy a spacious site that's off the tourist trail. We're right next door to the city centre, with all of Cambridge's main shops, bars and restaurants, and many of the departments and lecture sites (about 200 metres for the scientists!) Yeah, it's a while from the river and the [University Library](http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/) but we're spared the coachloads of tourists that plague Cambridge in the summer and we love our [duck pond](https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/discover/ducks/)!

We also have an outdoor swimming pool for use in summer term, tennis courts on the paddock and squash courts on site which are all free to use.

## Size

There are around 150 students in each year, so Emma's small enough that you'll get to know most people by the end of your first year. However, with over 600 students (including around 100 graduates) it's also big enough to allow you to make a wide variety of friends with lots of different interests and backgrounds.  

## Academic Record

We have a really strong academic record. This means that the quality of teaching at Emma is generally very high and a lot of academic support is given to its student. 

## Accommodation

You get [accommodation](https://ecsu.org.uk/prospective/accommodation/) for your entire undergraduate career, including the fourth year. Compared to other colleges, rents are reasonable. Rooms vary in size and cost, but they're all of a good standard, including a bed, wardrobe, desk, access to a fridge, a comfy chair, and desk light.
