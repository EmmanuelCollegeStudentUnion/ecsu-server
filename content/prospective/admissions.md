If you're thinking about applying to Emmanuel, then you'll need to first of all complete your [UCAS form](http://ucas.com/) and send it to UCAS by their deadline. After your chosen College has received your application you will need to fill in a Supplementary Application Questionnaire (SAQ), and there may be other demands. Most interviews take place in December.

For a full explanation of the applications process you should visit the University's webpage about it [here](http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/apply/index.html).

Depending on your subject, you may be asked to send in an example of written work or sit a test (what happens may change each year).
