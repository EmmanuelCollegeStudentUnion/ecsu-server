subtitle: 'Who to contact about coming to Cambridge? '
---
If you have any questions about admissions to Emmanuel College or Cambridge in general there are a number of people you can contact: 

## General &amp; Specific Admissions Enquiries

General questions and specific admissions enquiries should be addressed in the first instance to Miss Lesley Shaw, the Emmanuel College Admissions Officer.

## Freshers Reps

Whilst admissions and academic enquires should be sent to the Admissions Office, if you have an offer and want advice on college/student life, accommodation, food etc., the Freshers Reps will be more than happy to answer your questions.

## Access Officer

Throughout the year the ECSU Access Officer will also be willing to answer any queries about the application process and Cambridge life in general. 

## University Admissions Policy &amp; Questions

Matters of University, rather than College, admissions policy should be directed to the Cambridge Admissions Office (CAO).
