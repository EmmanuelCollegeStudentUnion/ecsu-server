Once you go through a few prospectuses, you realise that every college calls itself 'friendly' at some point, and Emma is no exception. However, life at Emma genuinely is friendly thanks partly to the best and cheapest bar in Cambridge, a wealth of societies, and a shared appreciation of our beloved ducks.

## Societies and Sport

It's really easy to get involved in societies, simply because there are so many - check out our societies page to find out more!

## Entertainment in Emma

During term Emma hosts our own regular club night: Emma Ents, a popular night featuring accomplished DJs playing whole range of music styles from Afrobeat to Drum'n'Bass to Hip Hop. In the Old Library, the Emmanuel Music Society sometimes puts on recitals and the MCR hold jazz nights. 

Twice a term, we have our notorious bar extensions in which the bar is open until 2am, featuring cheesy music, fancy dress and student DJs.

## Cambridge Clubs

Cambridge itself has 4 main clubs: Ballare (aka "Cindies), Fez, Lolas and Vinyl (aka "Life"). 

Wetherspoons opens up its doors as a clubbing venue on a Friday and Saturday night. The Cambridge Junction also holds occasional club nights.
