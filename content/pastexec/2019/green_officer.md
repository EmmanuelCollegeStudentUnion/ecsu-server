**Hi, I'm Lucy(she/her) your Green and Ethical Officer**

I'm a second year undergrad studying Natural Sciences.

My role on the committee includes liaising with students and the college, as well as organising events related to green and ethical issues(e.g. events in green week, talks, second hand sales ...)

Please get in touch with anything you want to see changed around college or anything at all, I'd love to hear from you 

Lucy xx
