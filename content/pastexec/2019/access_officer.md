Hi! I'm Louis, Emma's access officer, and I'm responsible for coordinating outreach schemes like CUSU shadowing, ECSU shadowing, and the access bus.

My role also includes supporting disadvantaged students within Cambridge, which might include running access-related events for current students, welfare, and addressing any access-related concerns within college.
