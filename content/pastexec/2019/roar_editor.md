My name is Yoseph and I'm a 2nd year historian. I'm the ROAR editor (or editROAR) which means I write the weekly brunch newsletter. I'm from Croydon, which **IS **in London and that is **NOT** up for debate. Beside ROAR, within Emmanuel I play rugby, and outside of it I am a member of CamFM, because not only do I think the stuff I write is hilarious but I am also love the sound of my own voice. In my manifesto I talked about how I wanted to incorporate more people into ROAR by having regular submissions so if you would like to write about something that's happened in Emmanuel or you think you can do better than me, feel free to get in touch.
