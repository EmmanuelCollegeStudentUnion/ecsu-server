Hi everyone! I'm **Robyn** and I'm reading **Geography** in my penultimate year here at Emma.

As **Secretary**, I'm in charge of ECSU's admin. This means taking minutes at weekly meetings, sending out weekly 'What's On' newsletters about events/ opportunities that might interest ECSU members, designing and ordering the committee's stash, organising inter-college JCR swaps and photos for all Emma societies!

If you're interested in advertising something in What's On, organising a swap with our student union, have a query about the format/ accessbility of minutes or there's anything ECSU-related you want to talk about, please feel free to get in touch via my ECSU email.
