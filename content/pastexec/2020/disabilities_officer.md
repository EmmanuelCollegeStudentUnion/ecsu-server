Hello! I'm Cerys and I am the new 2021 ECSU Disabilities and Mental Health Officer! My role involves signposting routes of support as well as liaising with college about Covid guidelines. During my time in ECSU, my aims as DMH officer include creating a resource for international disabled students, starting a buddy or induction scheme and working with the welfare officers to host collaborative check-in events during term!
