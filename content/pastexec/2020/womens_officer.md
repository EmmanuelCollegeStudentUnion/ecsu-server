Hi !! I’m Cath (she/her), and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to make Emma a more welcoming and supportive place for women and non-binary students here. I’m hoping to run an active FemSoc to help foster a social community within Emma, and simultaneously create structural change through initiatives like harassment procedure reform and the establishment of a private therapy fund. I’m excited to get to work, and hope that my role means I get to meet loads of lovely new people!
