Hello, Iâ€™m Eddie. As Green and Ethical Officer for ECSU 2021 I have many things that I really want to achieve. I hope to make Emmanuel switch to a more ethically-friendly bank (from Barclays), organise a fun and accessible green week regardless of whether we are at college or not, work with 'Cambridge defend jobs' to better protect the rights of college staff and with much more! 

I look forward to working with the other members of ECSU to make Emmanuel a better place not only for the students and staff but environmentally too!
