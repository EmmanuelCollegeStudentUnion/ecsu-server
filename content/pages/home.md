      We represent student perspectives and views on college committees,
      speaking up for undergraduates at every level of decision-making and
      governance. We sit on Cambridge SU councils and forums, ensuring that
      Emmanuel students are heard on broader issues affecting the University.

      We produce a comprehensive timetable of welfare provisions each term, from
      drop-in signposting sessions to pub quizzes in the bar. We recognise that
      liberation and welfare go hand in hand, always working with
      intersectionality in mind.
