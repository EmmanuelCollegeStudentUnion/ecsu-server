      As well as being an initial port-of-call, we produce a comprehensive
      timetable of welfare events each term. Our liberation officers play a key
      role in welfare, helping us to truly address intersectionality.

      We run initiatives such as Access Bus, encouraging the brightest students
      to apply regardless of background, and work on post-admissions access,
      tackling elitism & privilege experienced by current students.

      sustainable practices, and advocate on behalf of marginalised students,
      fighting for a college and university that is more equal for all.
