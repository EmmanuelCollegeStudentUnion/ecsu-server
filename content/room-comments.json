If you're a poor sod at the bottom of the ballot like I was, choose 6,7,8 over 4,5 because they're nice and sunny and look out into the garden.Blantyre negatives: mainly small rooms, not in college, absolutely insane housekeeper.Blantyre positives: really great dining room and tv room area (great for dinner parties), combi ovens and hobs, laundry on site, not as far from the world as Barnwell, next to the gym and a supermarket, kebab shop, Domino's, noodle place...Basically, Blantyre's not great, but like everything, it's what you make of it. A group of ten of us all ended up here together and had a really fun time. So: don't make Blantyre your first choice, but don't kill yourself if you're forced to live here either... Drag your friends down with you."

Apart from that, the rooms not great- v small- 3 paces wide by 5 long- so no room to swing a cat once bed, desk, wardrobe, fridge & sink thrown in. Luckily, you don't have to spend all your time in there- Blantyre's got a common dining room & a tv room (with a tv and evreything), as well as probably some of the best kitchen facilities you'll get- combi-oven and hobs. So to stop claustrophobia setting in, get a group of you to live here & use the communal areas lots.There's also a laundry and housekeeper thrown in- one very useful, the other needs to be handled with care."

Before coming to live in this room I was really worried about what it would be like but it's really grown on me - I rather like it.Blantyre in general is rather nice. There has been a bit of a reputation over the last few years of it being a \"mathmo-compsci-physical natsci house\" where no one really knows each other but this year that was not the case and it has been wonderful. If you can get a group of friends to live in Blantyre house then you will have a wonderful time!It's a reasonable length but not very wide - it's probably about as wide as three beds side by side and probably almost as long as 2 beds end on.The view is overlooking the garden which is nice. You have a sink. This is very near the common room so you can go there if you want to be social but the room is far enough away so as to not get noise if the common room is noisy.Toilets and showers are about 10 seconds away.This is probably not a room to go for if you like entertaining people but that being said you can easily get 4/5 in to watch a film.In summary - not your first choice of room but you could do considerably worse. Nice for a grade 2."

The view is not that bad (you can just about see some of Blantyre's back garden and spy on people as they go to get their bikes from the bike shed). South east facing so plenty of light especially in the mornings although the curtains are dark enough for sleeping in. Furniture includes a bed, cupboard, desk, fridge on table, chest of drawers and two chairs. Pale green walls (painted this year) and blue/green carpet. Picture rail useful for hanging posters etc. During the day the room is very quiet although it can get quite noisy if there are a lot of people / loud music in the common room which is below.Blantyre in general is a fantastic place to live with plenty of bathrooms, kitchens, a common room / TV room, friendly housekeeper and only a 10 minute walk from college."

Masses of storage space with two wardrobes, one of which includes an ancient and interesting-looking book case (yet to be investigated). Walls and carpets in reasonable/grotty condition. It's also on the other side of the house from the housekeeper, meaning your illicit '+8 in a room shocka' gatherings stand a slightly higher chance of going undetected.It's a good room and probably one of (if not the) best on this side of the house."

Very close to laundry, 2 showers, toilet and kitchen. Blantyre has a common room, which is on the other side of the house from this room, which means you always have a shelter from the ongoing parties in commong room!negative points-it's close to the main gate which is quiet noisy. Other than that, it's a great room, and definetly recomended!"

High ceilings. Can be very cold in winter - just work out how to use the radiator. Not double-glazed: the windows rattle when it's windy, but not a big deal because it faces onto the back garden.Beside two bathrooms and a kitchen - can be a little noisy but also never a big deal - and quick access to the facilities."

Both rooms and the living room have been decorated this year (2007). Room has big window and built-in wardrobe, small desk, chest of drawers, and shelf space. Bring a lamp for the living room and wear lots of socks as it gets a tad chilly. Blantyre itself is a fantastic place to live provided you know and like the other residents. Only place in college with a common room/dining room/tv room. Hobs aplenty at the time of writing."

There are currently two big fridges in the lounge. The room itself is much larger than 32a, again with nice big windows. Can be a bit nosiy with the gate and people on the road, but it's a small price to pay! Over on the quieter side of the house (i.e. the other side to the common room) so you don't get the noise from parties etc."

        "Comment": "H1aRoom H1a might not have a basin but it really is very close to the ground floor toilet and kitchen - if you could call the palatial room furnished with a lonely double hob a kitchen. For those who have particular urges to urinate/vomit in sinks after a night on the lash there is the enviable choice between those offered in the kitchen or the toilet. The place is generally very warm as the radiator provides a strong current from six a.m. until closing time. At night it can become a little cool due to the single-glazed windows, so shut the curtains to preserve that warmth. Sometimes the door wobbles slightly when people swing the staircase door. This creates an irritating anonymous knocking, but ensuring that the outer door to the lounge as Senem and I liked to refer to it is closed solves this minor nuisance. A southern exposure fills the room with a sense of light and spaciousness, though late-afternoon sun, particularly in the winter, can distract and dazzle a reader at the desk. The view from the large, wooden, paned windows is over a small car park and the paddock towards Old Court. An observant occupant can use this fantastic vantage point to chose to be in, or out, when visitors arrive. The single bed is tucked into a tidy alcove in the room - this helps create a immediate sense of space when a guest enters the room, but may prove uncomfortable for the very tall, or very active, sleeper. The main light in the room is a terrible low-wattage bulb giving disgusting, pallid, yellow light. In the evenings it is suggested that a number of lamps be used as an alternative. In addition to the movement of the door in the breeze the precious silence of the room is occasionally disturbed by singing on the paddock, presumably by the sounds of tennis during exam term, as well as any trampolining in adjacent and superjacent rooms. There are plenty of sockets but perhaps one coffee table too many. The built-in wardrobe might prove limiting for a devout fashionista. The painted Welsh dresser provides a fine conversational feature. Offers are invited in the region of grade three."

Overall, a pretty decent set - if you consider sharing a good thing (which you must if you're considering OC) then its easily the 2nd best set in the ballot, and runs F4 close for the title (although that does get abit more light and is pretty hefty itself."

The door to the rooom closes annoyingly slowly and during the day light comes in from the one window all day long. You might think this would be good... but it is too bright really and you have draw the curtains. The desk is very large and features wings, and the storage space is adequate.

Recently painted, re-carpeted and re-curtained in greeny shades (not as bad as it sounds at all!!) On same floor as toilet and shower, bath is upstairs. Gyp room (..microwave room) is downstairs. Bus station view - not too noisy at all with double glazing - hardly notice it (though sunday mornings are a good time to air your room as the buses are way quieter on sundays!!) , might be stuffy in the summer (but i had a similar facing room last year and it was ok).Bad points: standardly bad cooking facilities as with all of north court. Person on the floor below will probably have a piano, but again this is the case in lots of north court rooms. THE DOOR AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS IF IT ISNT LATCHED. (not exactly a bad point...but its not great to be locked out your room at 3am when a bit drunk!). Great choice if u are low in the ballot and happy to live in college."

The room is double glazed which cuts out almost all of the noise, and also keeps the room quite warm.The room is a quite big and is very close to the shower/toilet. Unfortunately this means you can hear the flush (and the refill), which is quite loud, and lasts over a minute. This can get quite annoying. The room also doesn't get any light.Overall, it's not too bad for a grade 3, but I'd recommend going for an inward facing room if possible. If you get this room, invest in some ear plugs. You will need them."

        "Comment": "Thin walls, but this doesn't tend to be a problem if you're only noisy in the living room. Gigantic room. One plug socket in bedroom, two in living room, two in \"kitchen\" - bring extension leads. Sink in bedroom, takes ages to run hot water. Bigger fridge than in any other single room in college. The \"kitchen\" is about as big as a wardrobe, but quite a lot of storage space. Comes with a microwave, nobody seems to mind you having a kettle and toaster. Stairs are a bit scary when you're drunk and wearing heels, although this is probably partly why I haven't been portered despite loud parties.Furniture: one cabinet, one chest of drawers, one desk with drawers, one normal-sized wardrobe, a bed, two armchairs, two wooden chairs, a coffee table, a bedside table, a writing desk (works well as a food prep area). I advise bringing a lamp and a big rug to make the room less sparse, and maybe some cushions to use as extra seating, and a radiator key because the room is at the top of the college heating system so radiators need to be bled every fortnight or so. This may be a good thing come summer, when roaring heating isn't exactly desired.Two windows in each room, so gorgeous views over the paddock and chapman's garden. Not a huge amount of light, especially in the late afternoon/early evening.Internet connection is via wireless which is pretty temperamental.Toilets & showers being in South Court is a right pain, but the facilities are quite good when you actually make it down there. Best room I've ever had in college. Awesome party venue."

It's an OK size but there's no coffee table and only one extra chair so it's not that easy to entertain guests. I tend to keep my curtain shut since it's on the ground floor which makes it a little dark.

It really is like a flat, and my friends call it the 'country cottage' because it still has the original grate in the fireplace - its one of only two New Court sets, the other being N5, that does. Being on the top floor the ceilings are slightly lower but I actually prefer this - it makes the room more snug. Walls are freshly decorated in cream and there's a new carpet. Having your own bathroom is incredible, the shower is pretty powerful. The bedroom window overlooks Savinos and the double glazing means minimal noise from the buses. Having your own little cupboard kitchen off the bedroom is fantastic too and the extractor fan stops the bedroom stinking of food when you cook. Honestly, you have everything you need in this room and could easily never leave!! Great for entertaining too as the living room has lots of chairs and a sofa and everyone will want to come round. Small downsides: the rent is just over �100 per week, but if like me you were low in the ballot in 2nd year and paid very low rent, it balances out this year. You also have to move all your stuff out of the room outside of NPR because rooms are used for guests, but this is a minor price to pay for the best room in college!"

Not that much noise from the street as it isnt a busy road and you can see up both Gresham and Glisson roads from the desk (in the bay window) which is good if you like distractions, otherwise you might want to rearrange the room a bit.

Has a weird mini-lobby which usefully blocks most noise from the stairs, so you can choose how sociable you want to be. The tree is really nice."

Far enough from common room to get peace when you don't fancy being kept awake. Basin is handy for brushing teeth/make up/shaving(??), but other than that a bit useless - water doesn't taste drinkable and hot and cold taps both run luke warm. Got back after Christmas hols to a FREEZING room since it has three external walls and the roof, which took about a week to warm up. Would recommend Blantyre for the speedy wired internet and great common area (but it's a long way from the boathouse!)."

Also, it's South facing which means its never too cold, and it's really cool being in the four attic rooms if you fill them out with your ballot group...All in all, I way prefer this to my Grade 5 South Court room of last year, but it's one you should definitely come and have a look at and see if you'd get on with it..."

It has two doors, one leading to the porch area of Blantyre and the other leading to the bathrooms and toilets etc. It is a really great part of the house: next to two really good showers, a toilet so close to your room it's basically en-suite, the laundry and a kitchen that is shared with 23 and 24. Despite the size of the room, it stays really warm in the winter. I guess the only disadvantages of this room is that the wired internet doesn't really work (the wireless signal is really strong though, so this doesn't really matter) and because it's next to the housekeeper, you can't really have big parties in here. She's pretty reasonable though, so I wouldn't let that put you off!"

I haven't had any problems with noise, but there is a bin lorry which comes a few times a week in the morning, which might wake up light sleepers. Still get rooms hoovered and bins emptied. And once you've done the walk a few times, Blantyre doesn't seem so far away! All in all, this is a really great room - probably only an option for people high up in the ballot!"

Only a tiny bit of wall is shared with anybody, and there is an entirely pointless 1msquare entrance lobby (doubles as a changing room), which means noise levels are low. Probably one of the best rooms in Blantyre, even though others are higher grades. Only downsides are the distance to the showers and the lack of the sink, although the toilets are really close so the sink isn't really an issue.

Potential problems are: the wall with 1a is thin, which would be an issue if you had a noisy neighbour, and the light on the outside is by the window, making the room a bit light at night"

Heating's fine.View of New Court's nice. View out back might be a bit of an issue for some - there's a bus stop outside and although on the first floor, most of the buses are double decker so there are people outside your window most mornings. Can't hear them because the windows are good but they can see in when the curtains are open.[2011] : Oh and you have to clear all of your stuff out each holidays which is annoying, but there are two biggish cupboards you can leave stuff in, plus college storage. Oh and the kitchen comes with a toaster, kettle, microwave, etc"

It's a decent size and the shape is a bit unusual, but isn't massively detrimental and creates a 'bedroom area' under the eaves which is quite nice. It is on the top floor which means lots of stairs, and people don't come up often so is probably nicer if you are in a group in 2nd or 3rd year, especially with freshers living on the lower floors. The gyp room is pretty small, but does its job and the toilets and sinks are right next door, which can be quite noisy at first, but it isn't a massive problem. Overall, it's a really nice room, and has more of a corridor feel because it is linked with both Q and R staircases."

        "Comment": "I would seriously discourage people from choosing this room, or to my knowledge any of the other new north court cloisters rooms. There seems to be a maintenance department directly below the rooms which means more often than not either your sleep or work is disturbed by loud drilling and sawing which manages to vibrate through the walls as if the drilling is in the room (I'm having to put my fingers in my ears between typing this it's so loud)!Other disadvantages are that the rooms aren't very big, the hot water goes off somewhere between 10pm-12, the ones on this side look out over a car park so leaving your window open at night inevitably ends up with you being woken up at 6am by people coming or going and obviously it's not a particularly nice view, and the rooms are quite dark during the day so if you're working during the day you generally have to switch the desk lamp on to see properly. There are some advantages, there's a lovely kitchen with a hob which can be great for being sociable, the attached bathroom is nice and there's a huge storage cupboard. In my personal opinion having lived here for a year the advantages really do not outweigh the disadvantages, especially for being the most expensive rooms in college."

Lock system adds extra security and green-ness however it can be annoying if you have someone in your room and you can't take the card out since all the lights go out. Hobs and kitchen are really nice. Apart from lack of combination oven which I'm trying to sort out. Showers and toilets are brilliant with one between three people. Noise is ok. The bus station gives some noise but its never disturbed me since the soundproofing is very good. Finally it can be a bit out of the way socially surrounded by freshers, bbut subway is really convenient. It's a nice new room in a nice location."

There are windows on both sides, (but on one side they are pretty small), and a small window seat which looks out onto Parker's Piece. When the wind blows, it is pretty loud, and the room could really use with a paint job (there are tape/blu-tac stains all over the ceilings) and even a huge hole in the wall, but cover it with photos and it's fine."

I would say the only problems are the size (it really is very small) and possibly the fact that quite a lot of people have to use the same shower.

        "Comment": "This room is on the first floor in a more modern extension, behind the older houses. The common-room is just downstairs, which is good, but the doors can easily block out the sound if essays beckon. The window faces south-west, so for much of the day the sun makes the room light, but also very warm. In fact, the room heats up very easily in general for a reason which is persistently elusive: I have had the window open even in winter. The sink is a point in the room’s favour, despite the hot tap’s frequent seven- or eight- minute long refusals to dispense hot water (a problem in the whole extension). As has been mentioned, the wall on one side is thin enough to hear coughs, music and reactions to Middlesbrough matches, so some mutual sensitivity is required between neighbours. There is a sizeable wardrobe. The internet connection has recently been vastly improved (it is now on the College network). It is slightly larger than room no. 16 next door, but not as large as no. 15, and has not really enough space to entertain many guests. The various disadvantages are not catastrophic, however; this room is cosy and economical and I have been happy."

Blantyre is now connected to the University data network (as of January 2012), and although people in the other side of the house seem to have problems with it, I haven't in this room, which means data speeds are fast, and comparable to rooms in college. There is a fairly big kitchen that is shared between rooms 22, 23 and 24, and has two hobs and a microwave. The room is next to the housekeeper, which is fine (except if you don't like hearing dogs barking late at night).

The proximity to hall is fantastic - no excuses for missing meals, and it's perfectly central within college for visiting n/s court and hostel.The main downside is the noise. At the weekend you need to be a heavy sleeper as Revs and Spoons are within view of the window and it can get very noisy. And during the day you'll need to get used to the regular 2 minute beeping from the crossing. There are outer and inner windows, but at the moment both don't quite shut properly, so the noise is not as muted as it could be.But if you don't mind the noise (and like me can sleep through anything) then it's a lovely room - high ceilings and sink. And 2 toilets and 1 shower between the four rooms. And one last thing, the shower is not hot. It is at best lukewarm, and there's nothing maintenance can do, so if that's of great importance I would look elsewhere!"

It is noisy when you hear the gate, and the common room noise can be quite annoying when trying to sleep. I have to wear earplugs which I don't mind but some people might. It's really nice to have a common room, there are often people in there working/chatting etc. It also means we don't have to invade anyone's space for socializing or celebrating. The kitchen is really handy, but very small which means that people other than from rooms 1, 2 and 3 don't tend to use it so not all bad (if a lot of people in the house are cooking sometimes you have to wait for a hotplate). Pretty sure most of the hotplates are working now though. Also there's 2 combi ovens in the whole house (not the nearby kitchen though).The room has been really cold with the cold weather. The window is really drafty so lets in loads of cold air, so I have sometimes kept my curtains closed all day just so I don't freeze.Would recommend this room, especially as it's only grade 2. A lot of people are surprised when they hear the grade just because it's so big. There's a bed, desk, large chest of drawers and cupboard, good shelf space, two coffee tables, desk chair + 2 arm chairs, fridge, no sink (don't need one with the kitchen next door)."

The walls are really thin which means you can hear pretty much everything which happens in the rooms either side though (6 and 8), but as long as you like the people you're living with it's fine! Really good wireless and wired connection, and the heating is great - when you turn the radiator up or down it actually changes the temperature of the room appropriately! Astounding. There's a nice view out to the garden as well (shown in a picture) so you can watch squirrels/cats/people getting their bikes all day long. The room is pretty much identical to 6 and 8, and the same layout as 4 and 5 which face a wall and not the garden. I got this from being pretty close to the bottom of the ballot, but I think you can do much worse for a grade 2."

        "Comment": "This is a really great room, I love it! I would second everything said in the 2010 comment, and add that it's also nice and big. Currently it's only a grade 3, and you get so much for it - I reckon if it were in college it would be a grade 5 or 6.I would say the best thing about this room is the French doors - they let in a lot of light, they can let in/out air, they allow easy access to the bike sheds (particularly good in the morning lecture rush!), you can catch friends on their way in/out of the house (a good thing for me but probably not so good for them!), and they mean that if you lose your college card (which you need to get in through the front door to the whole house) you can still use your key to get into your room through the back (providing you haven't lost your key as well!). This last point is also good if you've got a friend staying who you have to split up with for some reason - one of you can take the key and the other the card, and both can access the room providing the front room door is left unlocked.Another thing to add is that it's got a really good radiator and the windows have a twisty lock (lots of the others in the house are the ones that you lift) so I haven't had a problem with being cold, and the windows don't rattle.I've found the main disadvantages to be the tiny kitchen and the almost-useless shower (it's more of a drizzle) - but my kind friends on the other side of the house let me use their kitchen and I always use the other showers (these are better than my shower at home!), so it's not too much of a problem :)Also the distance from college is a bit inconvenient, but on the whole I really don't mind it - it feels more relaxing because it's a bit further towards the edge of the Cambridge bubble, and the common room means that I still get to see most of my friends every day.On the whole I can highly recommend both Blantyre and this room, and I hope everything goes well for you if you're stressed out trying to decide where you want to live :) Libbie x"

It had a fantastic large wardrobe for a grade 1/2,a sink with sizable cupboard underneath, clean carpets and lots of shelf space. It also has double glazed windows which keep outside noise out and inside heat in.The negatives are that there is a shower underneath and with the sun shining in, the room is always warm. I have never had to turn the heating on, even in midwinter. Also a some sound can be heard from two rooms next door, but only if its extremely loud. Normal conversations can't really be heard!"

Could possibly be a problem for tall people, I'm 5 foot 7 and it's been fine for me, but if you're taller than that might be worth checking it out for yourself. It looks out onto the street, which means that sometimes it's a bit loud at night but as it's a residential area it's not too bad. Also Blantyre itself is a great place to live so definitely consider it!"

        "Comment": "This is a great room. It has two massive windows which face south and east over gardens, so you get a nice view and loads of natural light. The curtains are good at keeping it dark enough to sleep in in the mornings, though. The downside of the windows is that they are single glazed, and it can get quite cold in winter if it's a grey day - bring a hot water bottle and obtain an extra blanket!The room is an interesting shape, which makes it seem more personal. I really like the layout, and you can move stuff around if you want. Large built in wardrobe with ample space - I converted half of mine into a pantry instead. Nice decoration, and close to a good sized kitchen with two hob rings and two microwaves in it (apparently we're not allowed a combi oven though). Furniture includes bed, desk, desk chair, comfy chair, chest of drawers, fridge on table, coffee table and built in wardrobe. There is a bathroom and shower/toilet room on the same floor which is handy, but there are two more showers downstairs which have much better water pressure. Laundry room also downstairs with a washing machine and dryer, although the dryer doesn't usually dry your clothes all the way. Next to the laundry room there's another kitchen which has a combi oven, which I've used a couple of times.I was warned that this room had the reputation of being the 'spider room', but I haven't seen any so far this year. I put conkers on the windowsills because apparently that discourages spiders. If you do get spiders, I heartily recommend this method. One last tip - this room is a favourite ladybird-hibernating location. If you open the windows during Michaelmas term, hordes of ladybirds will take up residence in the corners of your room over the winter. I personally didn't mind, but they tended to start dying all over the floor come January.Overall a really good room, with great value for money. It's a less than 5 minute cycle to college, so it's easy to go in for stuff. I didn't tend to use hall very much because the kitchen let me cook for myself and my friends much more than I could last year."

        "Comment": "This room is a nice size for a Grade 2: it's got plenty of wardrobe space and storage on top of it and under the bed. It has all the mod-cons: standard bed, newish fridge, desk, vaguely uncomfortable desk chair and another much comfier chair which is unfortunately too low for the desk. Being on the south-west side of the house, you are precariously positioned above the housekeeper, but I haven't found it a problem as the room's size isn't that well suited for socialising. You're also a long way from the common room, which is good for noise levels, but may be a drain on your social life. On the plus side, you're right next door to one of the kitchens, which is nice and big and only gets used by immediate neighbours on the corridor. There's also plenty of storage space in there for utensils if it gets too full in your room.The room faces the street so there's not much of a view and occasionally there's a bit of noise at night or early morning, but it's not been a problem for me. It also doesn't get much sun in the mornings or in midwinter, but there's usually a nice glow in the afternoon and the main light is good and bright once it's warmed up. The heating hasn't been a problem at all and even on the coldest nights you might find yourself too warm if the radiator is on full blast.As with all Blantyre rooms, you're a long way from college so handing in work in the small hours can be a drag, and unless you've got a friendly chef nearby or want to eat Domino's every night, you may have to cook regularly. I've found eating at hall for lunch means you can usually eat light in the evening, though.All in all, a very nice, comfortable room with few problems."

This whole side of the building was double glazed last Summer (2012) so the noise from the street isn't a problem at all - you can barely hear it. There's plenty of storage space (wardrobe, chest of drawers, wall unit with shelves and cupboards). The room has a sink and is handy in being right next to the loo on the ground floor of the staircase, so you don't have to pop down into the basement - good for laziness.

Only negatives are it's a bit loud with the buses going past in the night, and the bedroom gets a bit cold because the only radiator is in the living room. There's a kitchen on the same floor with no hobs, but there are hobs upstairs and downstairs so it's not a problem at all.

You have a sink which is super useful and the gyp room is super handy right next door. There's a sofa and 3 chairs in the room, so you definitely have enough space to host people.

In the summer it'll be a great view!Like past comments, the following things might be annoying or inconvenient:The radiator is only in one room, so it can get quite cold in the bedroom.Because the room is north-facing, there isn't so much light (which might be a good thing for some people!) But it does mean that you won't get blinded from floods of sun!The staircase toilet is on the ground floor, and the showers are in the basement.The kitchen is so-so. There is a working hob. But if you're planning to cook a dinner for twelve, it ain't happening...Good points:It's still a nice room. You will need some extra furniture (like your own pieces from home, lamps, etc.) to fill up the space.The wireless router is in the room! (So great WiFi!)The kitchen is on the same floor. There is a combi-oven on the floor below.

Essentially the same as all the other front facing sets, just a grade lower (and the same grade as the back-facing ones) because of the view I assume. Furniture is new and pretty decent, carpet and chairs could be less...brown... but apart from this very nice. Temperature control very good - there are nice hot pipes all the way along the skirting board on the front wall and a radiator, which I keep turned off because the pipes do so well.Only disadvantage is that the view and privacy aren't as good as the floors above because that hedge at the back of the paddock hides the car park in front of hostel, which has plenty of people walking through it.Hostel as a whole is brilliant, decent gyp room access and lovely bedders (this year at least) and have only had to wait once for a shower (total 5 showers and 5 toilets in the basement for the whole of H and J, and more toilets on other floors). Laundry is epic, and dropping it off on the way to the shower has the huge advantage of getting in there before anyone else in college, so it's often done before the end of the day!"

Being in the top corner, this room doesn't get an awful lot of sun but you do get a good view over New Court and can see the top of chapel, which is nice. Also means you're above bus-level so don't have people looking into your bedroom at the back. Being on the corner nearest St. Andrews Street you do get occasional nighttime revelry noise, although it hasn't been that bad in my experience.The bedroom has a slightly strange diagonal wall situation going on, but this actually makes it a tiny bit bigger than others in New Court, so not much to complain about.Basically an extremely nice room, I've been very happy with it :)"

However this year, 2013-2014, I am yet to hear them at all.However I will agree with the room being a little smaller than it's grade would lead on, however I would hardly call it small at all, you have a large wardrobe, chest of draws, good amount of shelf space and the ensuite, which is the main reason the room is small.You will be woken up by staff arriving in the morning if you leave your window open at night, but that isn't a huge issue really, and you can't hear anything with the windows shut thanks to it being a new room.So overall in my opinion I am very happy to have lived here, and yes it is a grade 7, but when it comes down to it, that isn't much more money than a grade 5 or 6 so definitely worth it."

The card reader saves energy and you get used to it fast; similarly, there is a persistent, inextinguishable beeping noise which you stop noticing after a week or two. The light isn't so great, and it's not huge (approx. the size of the South Court grade 3s), but the furnishing is near hotel-standard and the closet is actually surprisingly spacious."

Faces the bus station, but the new double glazing means you get used to the noise quite easily. A tree blocks out pretty much all the light except in winter, so you need the light on all the time. No sink in the room, but right next to a shower and toilet, both with sinks, and the shower is lovely and powerful. Big gyp room upstairs for the whole staircase with hobs and sinks."

It is a fairly reasonable size for a grade 3, and has a window seat, as well as one casual chair and desk chair. The storage is fairly good, but not in excess.The toilet and shower are on the same floor and shared between four so rarely have to wait. The bus station noise isn't too bad, the fridge is probably worse, but if you are really sensitive to noise you might want to avoid it. It does mean you can't open the windows without fumes/noise. You can hear the music student's room in Z, so that may or may not be a problem depending on the person. The lights and electricity are linked to your university card, which despite being extremely eco-friendly it is rather inconvenient sometimes...The heating works well, and you have a thermostatic radiator valve so can set the temperature to taste easily, however the landing is really cold in the winter as the radiator there is woefully undersized. The kitchen is on the floor above, but is well equipped and spacious. All in all a good room for its grade."

Inward facing - no bus noise, lots of nice sunlight in the morning.Recently refurbished - curtains are not green anymore, thankfully.Lots of storage space: chest of drawers, cupboards, and shelves.Furniture is new.Double doors are handy for isolating yourself (and your neighbour) in from potential staircase noise if you need an early night (rower). Kitchen is just across the landing - well equiped with four hobs. No combi oven though unfortunately!Nicest room in Y staircase I would say - Y5 is the mirror image of it. Only problem is an occasionally noisy rumbling fridge. You get used to it though."

It faces the bus station, which doesn't massively bother me, (except for the occasional bang of a bus crashing into the fence behind college!) - but is very noticeable as soon as any windows are open, and would probably disrupt light sleepers. Kitchen facilities are 2 hobs per floor of 6 people - never particularly have any problems using them - though it would be nice to have a combi oven, not just a microwave. On the floor, theres 1 shower room, 1 toilet and 1 shower/toilet. Between 6 again, I've only ever had to wander up/downstairs once or twice. Bedder is very nice and happy to be flexible on when your room is cleaned - she keeps the kitchen very tidy, which is normally very good, although occasionally results in stuff migrating to a box on the landing!Furniture wise, it's standard. Bed. Office Chair (Swivels, but low back, so not great!), bedside table - 3 large drawers, built in wardrobe (decent size, not massive though), good above desk shelves and a big cupboard. Heating is excellent - hasn't ever broken, and is adjustable to various points between \"Arctic\" and \"Sauna\".Overally a very nice room, especially if you can stand the noise, or have some fascination with buses? There are some better value rooms around - Y5/6 are slightly bigger (I lived there first year) and are same grade, despite being courtyard facing. I'd also suggest the Y kitchens are better than those on Z, Although Z staircase is bigger (You have two Fellows up top, so I think 14 rooms are available vs 7/8 in Y.) Oh, and the intercoms let you speak to people, but only occasionally actually let them into your staircase, so trips to the bottom of the staircase become a fairly regular occurence!"

Being on the ground floor is great in that don't have to trek up and down the stupidly steep old court steps and it's probably a bit less noisy, you can also climb in and out of the windows easily which is fun. That said, other people can also climb in and out of the windows easily and being on the ground floor feels like a bit of a security risk, especially as every one can see into the living from the paddock. Both rooms are quite large, the chapman's garden facing room is longer and narrower and quite shady but a lot more private, the paddock facing room is lovely but like a goldfish bowl, so you might end up having to draw the curtains 24/7 anyway. I reckon the chapman's garden side is better, especially as there's a box ledge (with hot water pipes underneath, which make it nice and toasty) next to the bed at exactly the right height, so you essentially have quite a bit more bed space, but it's pretty gloomy, and the apparent privacy can be deceptive. Both rooms have quite a bit of storage space, comes with table and chairs, the college standard two seater sofa etc. To be honest the whole place could do with re-plastering and re-painting, as occasionally we've found random chunks of masonry on the floor - once tried to move a poster and a (smallish) chunk of wall came away with it. That said it's probably looking considerably better than previous years, the poor abused room has had a rest year. And they deep clean the carpets. They said we were getting toilets and showers.. we're still waiting, maybe it'll happen for you. Downsides? Lots of people telling you how they've chundered all over your room."

And if you choose the right person, it really is loads of fun sharing a set. Being close to Front Court and being ground floor does make you wary of security more but as long as you do remember to lock your windows before you leave then you'll (probably) be fine. You will get tourists peeking in through the main window but I've never found it a problem and you can close the curtains after all.Both bedrooms can get rather a lot of noise (from Spoons or just people walking past on Paddock side). One of the biggest old court sets though, and really good bedroom sizes for both people.If you're even considering Old Court you're probably aware of the loo/shower situation but then by next year you may well have loos and showers in Old Court anyway..."

Positives are proper wood panelling, it's on the first floor so high ceilings and nice and light, good furniture with big table. You can also get away with murder in terms of the size of parties.

PT10 has not been renovated recently but its decent and there are 2 toilets, 1 shower and 1 very GYP room for 4 people.No sink in this room but many chairs, a huge double cupboard and a wardrobe for clothes plus plenty of shelves and a chimney. Ground floor means you can hear the front door slam when someone uses it and there is sometimes noise for parkers piece (some buses during the day) but shutters + the fact everyone uses the back door limits noise.

Great for hosting. A great view.Downsides: some noise from the road (buses stop not too late, but there's the occasional noisy car going by), rather rattly windows, and floor creaky in the middle. So don't go for this room if you're unable to work or sleep with quite a bit of noise going on. The current lighting can sometimes be a little dim-leave the main light on for a while before you're going to need it. People can sometimes see in, but there are shutters.No sink, but there is a wireless port contrary to what is currently on the site (it took a while to find-it's on the very bottom slot of the middle bookshelf).The house is bright inside, with oranges and reds."

Obviously it has less natural light than the rooms at the front, which look over Parkers Piece, but it's fine, and it's nice to have a view of the garden. Ceilings are really high so it feels very roomy. Good storage space, but no sink. The only real drawback with the house is that the kitchen is tiny - smaller than a South Court gyp room. It does have hobs, but no table like some other PT houses. This is because the whole second floor of the house has been converted into a fellow's flat, which also means there's only one bathroom (though with only four undergraduate rooms this isn't really a problem)."

I'm told the kitchen in the attic is one of the biggest in college, and it has a table and benches for you to sit at to eat. Bathroom now has a shower (hot water works fine), showerhead isn't too fantastic but still okay. PT13 is often used for guests and grads, so you may get people coming/moving in and out, but they're on the levels below and have their own toilet facilities. Lastly, soundproofing between rooms is quite good, so if your doors are closed it's hard to hear your neighbours!"

It is in the basement and doesn't get the sun, but I've never found it too dark, possibly because the whole house was repainted in summer 2012. It also has great storage space - currently 3 shelves, a chest of drawers and a wardrobe. It really doesn't matter that I don't have a sink because I'm the only one on the 2 lower levels, so I have sole use of the \"communal sink\" which is about 3 metres from my room. The shower is also only shared with a handful of people.The house may not technically have a hob but everybody in 19 and 20 uses the hobs in 20 which are in the gyp room in the basement, so again, a few metres away. Currently, the gyp room in the basement of 19 has a combi oven anyway.

Being at the back of the house it doesn't get as much sunlight as other rooms, but again not a big problem at all. Overall brilliant for grade 3!"

        "Comment": "I would agree with all the good comments below! This room is a really good size for a grade 3 and the doors and window let a lot of sun in especially in the morning. The only thing about the patio doors is that the room can get cold unless you bolt them at the top and bottom - this is only a problem if you want to leave through them because you can't bolt them from the outside! But when it's warm outside it's lovely :) The doors are single-glazed (but don't rattle) and the other window is double-glazed. The radiator is fairly powerful so I haven't been cold (there was one time where it gave up and I froze slightly for two days but then it fixed itself). The room has pretty good furniture - big desk with lots of drawers, wardrobe, chest of drawers, three chairs, fridge table, bedside/coffee table, strange little footstool thing, bed, desk lamp. I would recommend bringing your own duvet though or another blanket because this one is pretty thin. No sink but the toilet and kitchen aren't far away. There are only two sockets behind the desk so I would recommend bringing a plug extension plank thing or rearranging the room (there are four more sockets elsewhere) so that you can plug the fridge, your laptop and the lamp in at the same time!The nearest kitchen is shared between a lot of people (7 I think?), but was manageable this year. It has a microwave and hotplates that actually get hot, no combi oven but there are two elsewhere in Blantyre. The shower is not great - the most annoying thing is that if you're the first one to use it in the morning it takes 5-10 minutes to warm up. But usable once it's warm! There are only 4 showers in Blantyre overall, which seems like very little but I've never had to wait for the shower (I don't have 9ams though).I think Blantyre is a lovely place to live, the distance from college is a little bit annoying if you just want to run up to print something or get a book out or get something from the vending machine, but otherwise it's fine! The common room is really nice for socializing or just eating/working in. The laundry is also really handy if you prefer to wash your own clothes and it surprisingly doesn't get too crowded!"

There is also an additional fridge table which I use as a coffee table. It has one of the new style, larger, square fridges which can be quite noisy but has a significantly larger capacity than the older ones. This room is quite small in comparison to other Blantyre grade 3 rooms but that's understandable given the ensuite and there's still enough room for most people. Though it is near a reasonably sized kitchen with hobs, it's also the kitchen used by the most people (Blantyre has 7 kitchens but this one is the nearest for 7 rooms) so it can get quite messy."

        "Comment": "Pretty decent for a grade 2, half of the window stares straight at a wall but you can still see some of the car space, grass and whatever (for anyone nosy you can see anyone coming and going on their bike too). The lamp is very bright but can effectively be dimmed by pointing it somewhere else... just be careful it doesn't fall off the desk because it's not very secure.You can often hear if people are still in the common room, especially if people are playing FIFA late at night. The noise didn't really bother me but if you're an early bird you might want to avoid that. Also the walls are pretty thin, so you can hear anything happening in the corridor and the room opposite (12). Birds can also be annoying early in the morning as the windows aren't very good. I had to stick wads of paper in the gaps to stop them rattling around when it was windy. The fridge is pretty small but I prefer it to a bigger fridge because it doesn't make any noise.The desk is easily big enough to work/eat on with enough drawers to store random stuff in like pads of paper and notes. There are a few shelves as well to store books/cereal/more random crap. The wardrobe is alright but it would be nicer if it was just a bit bigger. The closet is a good size for me but I don't really have much to hang so it might not be suitable for someone who relies on smart shirts and trousers all the time. Other furniture provided includes two chairs (one slightly higher for use at the desk, one slightly lower for chilling in if you ever have friends in (although given the room size that's probably unlikely) or maybe for reading in. I use it to store my dirty clothes. There's also a fridge table like in every room. The pin-board gets half-covered when the door's open which I assume would be annoying if anyone ever used the pin-board for much. The most annoying thing is the new mirror they installed because apparently everyone has to have one. While some rooms in Blantyre will have a reasonably-sized sink mirror or perhaps a floor-length wardrobe mirror, all room 11 now has is a rather pathetic head and shoulders mirror on the inside of the wardrobe. However the way the wardrobe opens means that you have to be awkwardly standing in a small square in the corner of the room to actually use said mirror (so usually you can't even see much because the light doesn't get there).The bed is standard 6'3'' size, there isn't room for a bigger bed if you need one and if you're any kind of tall you'll constantly hit your feet on the wardrobe (or the headboard). I made it more comfortable with a mattress-topper, I imagine it's not great without one, but most of the beds are the same anyway. It can be a bit creaky so if you choose to engage in wild lewd behaviour I suggest you go to their place. Also because the room across the corridor (12) will be able to hear everything going on.The wired internet is very good most of the time, the wireless not so much, but it's significantly better in this room than in the other parts of Blantyre, e.g. near the housekeeper it's pathetic and on the room 10 side of Blantyre you can actually get \"Uni of Cam\" with a slightly stronger signal than eduroam or EmmaBlantyre (still rubbish though).If you're a messy person, the room can feel a bit cramped sometimes, but it is more than adequate for a grade 2. The toilets/sink/bath (if you ever use the latter) are very close and two kitchens are reasonably close as well, including one of only two in Blantyre with a combi.In terms of temperature, the biggest difference is usually just whether or not the curtains are open. The windows can be a bit draughty in that respect, but I've never found the room particularly cold except when I'm up at about 3am rushing some work only wearing a t-shirt up top. I'm yet to experience summer in the room but given that the east is blocked by half of Blantyre I assume the room won't get too bright or hot.All in all it's pretty much what you'd expect from a grade 2, maybe slightly better. By far the worst thing about it is that it's in Blantyre which is so far away from everything (unless you're the kind of person who walks to lectures in which case you're probably fine). It can be nice to have a large group of people you know so close together though, even if it's slightly detrimental to work ethic (trust me on that one).Last comment: We recently got a flat-screen TV for the common room. Just saying."

Plenty of storage space with two wardrobes, two overhead cupboards, and a cupboard under the sink.

For all the annoyance of the slope it adds character to the room and feels a lot less generic than your standard south court room.There is lots of storage space too, also, definitely bring a spare lamp/light it can get pretty dingy if you don't."

The layout of the room is really nice and usable. Can be a bit isolated if you don't keep the door open (as your neighbours are the toilets) but if you have friends living around you then it is really nice!

        "Comment": "Fantastic room - loads of space for very little money, and the two huge windows make it feel even bigger. Plenty of sunlight which makes it a really nice place to work, especially in the evenings when lovely sunset colours come in through the smaller window. Loads of storage space except for the fridge, which can only fit about one meal's worth of food in - but with Tesco just down the road this isn't really a problem. Its also right next to the biggest kitchen in the house, and as I'm a rugby player I definitely appreciated having baths and a washing machine in the house. The showers are also far better than they were in my old room - good water pressure, even if lots of people using the water at once.Two points to bear in mind - the room is quite hard to heat in the winter, as it is single glazed with two external walls, so loses heat very quickly overnight but sunlight coming in through the windows heats it up a lot in the day. Basically it will be warm in the day time, then plummet overnight so it is cold in the mornings. The second point is that as mentioned above, the room does have its own ecosystem. Opening the windows in Michaelmas leads to an invasion of ladybirds from the colony outside, which seemed to survive pretty well for most of the term then started dying out in the last few weeks. This corrosponded with a number of large, well-fed looking spiders appearing. We are on freindly terms and they have been keeping me company throughout Lent term, but if you are not happy to offer lodgings to such guests this may not be the room for you.But overall: cheap, loads of space, lots of light, big kitchen, washing machine, baths and really not as far away as people think. Also super convenient if you are in the chemistry department a lot."

It is below sea level I believe meaning that there is very little natural light coming through the window (which only opens several inches meaning ventilation is not the best). It's a good size for a grade two and actually one of the bigger rooms in East Court. It has a bookshelf, wardrobe, desk, chest of drawers and a mantelpiece so you are well equipped! If the heating is on its like a sauna, if its not its freezing. The room is very near to a toilet and the showers and also next door to a kitchen with a microwave and hobbs which is very sociable. It is also right next to the entrance to the building. The ceilings are low, however, and I have frequently rammed by skull against the doorframe. The staircase down to the room is very narrow as well. Common to all the East Court rooms is the \"VERY talkative\" bedder (to quote the tactful 2012 comment on this room) which is more of an issue to this room because of its close proximity to the kitchen. It is cheap and you get what you pay for but I am content."

There is lots of storage space, a big enough wardrobe and drawers plus shelving space for all your books. Heating is great and manual so can be switched on and off when needed. Issues: the wall with 1a is thin... you get used to it though, headphones come in handy but it depends on your neighbour really. It is a great room for a grade 3, just the right amount of space and you don't have to walk up all those stairs to get to your room. Kitchen facilities are fine too, with showers downstairs in the basement and laundry beneath you (which is really useful as you can get your laundry in first on a Monday morning before the hoards get there meaning a quick turn around)."

The gyp room provides a good communal space for the corridor and is fitted out with hobs and a microwave/combi oven - these are popular, so sometimes you have to queue for them. There are two showers between seven, and three loos.Pros: Great view of North Court (esp. when sitting at the desk).Spacious, quite a lot of storage (walk in wardrobe as on the rest of T, lockable cupboard above it, dresser with plenty of shelf space, chest of drawers).Seating: Two armchairs and an office chair, as well as the windowsill/bench.Refurbished as of Lent 2015, so all of the fixtures and fittings in the gyp rooms and bathrooms are new.Cons: Noise from the staircase can be a little annoying at night, as this room is right next to the stairs, but closing the doors which link T01 & T02 to the rest of the staircase ameliorates this. No basin, but there is a loo just next door, so there is no real distance to go to get water.Key-card operated electrics, so people get locked out relatively often. NB: the single plug at the desk and the single plug to the right of it are not governed by the key card, and so can be used for a computer charger and the fridge.Only one gyp room on the ground floor, whereas the upper floors on T have two.The fireplace grate whistles, but if you cover it using a piece of A4 paper (held onto the metal with a small amount of blu-tack/sellotape) then the air-flow is blocked and the noise stops. This is a common problem on T."

It is on the first floor not the ground as listed so people can't look in as they walk around NC. It can be a little noisy as the room below is a piano room and there is no sound insulation between floors but, that will depend on who lives there and when you are in your room etc. It is well furnished - chest of drawers, dresser with shelving, fixed wardrobe, large desk, swivel desk chair, armchair, bed, bedside table, coffee table - all new and in good condition. Gyp room is slightly smaller than the one in Y but has two hobs that work well on every floor. Plenty of showers - I think 5 in total across the staircase and I haven't had any problems with them. The card accessed power is slightly annoying but it doesn't have the card activated locks that some of the newer staircases do. All in all pretty good. It is a higher grade than the ones around it despite being the same, or very similar, size and comparable in terms of facilities. The light and lack of bus noise do make quite a bit of difference though."

It can be a bit dark because it is in the basement but you do have your own door which is quite useful. 19 and 20 are connected through the basement so if you want to live out of college with a larger group of friends, this is the place. There is one gyp room and a kitchen both in the basement and shared between the 2 houses. They're both pretty rubbish but the kitchen does have hobs, a combi oven and a decent amount of space. Everything the person in 2009 said is still valid apart from the cat and the fact that 2009 is quite a long time ago now so calling the room recently decorated would be a lie. However everything is still in good condition and there are no chipped walls as is the case with some of the other rooms.Overall a nice room to live in if you decide to live out of college. Close access to kitchen and bathrooms and a sink in the room."

There's nice furniture, coffee table, chair, chest of drawers, shelves and a reasonably-sized wardrobe, although it did all need moving around at the beginning, but no bedside table. It's quite a large room and being on the top floor means it gets lots of light (the curtains aren't great and lights gets in in the mornings). Walls are quite thin but not a huge issue.Not in close proximity to a gyp room, there's one in the basement of Warkworth 20. Our basement is connected through to the basement of Warkworth 19 and so we share a communal kitchen, which is nice particularly if they're your friends. Bathroom one level down is nice and new.Living in a house has been a lot of fun, don't find the walk to college all that bothering. Except when doing laundry."

It's tiny, has one less chair than the other rooms of what is indisputably the worst corridor of the house, and due to the wall-facing window natural light is rather limited. To continue the mould motif, there is none; however, they refurbed it last year and the new carpet has that sort of industrial chemical smell to it which isn't great. Advantages are that it's very near the toilet, stairs leading to the upper part of the house, shower (shared by far too many people due to uneven shower distribution in the house), kitchen and common room. Having said that, the walls are paper thin so pray you don't have a promiscuous neighbour: I once heard a phone go off next door and it was on vibrate.In conclusion, avoid this cave of a room if you can."

As mentioned before, really good value for a Grade 2, lots and lots of light, two wardrobes, 3 chairs and a big coffee table. Near enough to the common room to be sociable, but not so near that it's a nuisance. The walls ARE really thin (I have been woken up by my neighbour's alarm before) but this hasn't really been an issue for me. Don't buy in to all the Blantyre hate - I would definitely recommend this room!"

Blantyre is a lovely place to live and has definitely helped me both work harder in the day as I stay in college and relax more in the evening. All of the attic gets a little hot sometimes so a small fan can be usefull. In addition it can be dark. The best light in the room by far is the desk lamp. If you bring a lamp and a fan though it is a truly great room. It's quiet enough to work when other people are having pres but also you can just go downstairs and find someone to talk to in the common room. I would thoroughly recommend taking all 4 attic rooms as a balloting group as it creates a lovely tiny community. You should probably be able to cycle so it doesn't even feel that far from college. It takes about 5 minutes to get to college and 12 to get to the sidgwick site. There are 2 shops nearby and both serve alcohol until 11 unlike little sainsbury's."

This one looks over the road which is nice to people watch from, and noise has never been a problem for me.Pros - Characterful and well sized room for the money, is a full length mirror just outside, can be nice if you can get a group of 3 other friends in the other attic rooms.Cons - Can be a little isolating at times - not like Old South where people wonder into your room. The lighting is pretty terrible, bring as many lamps as you can. There isn't very much storage room. There's no running water on the floor - but you are paying for a Grade 1."

It's definitely worth more than a grade 2, which I reckon was only given because it doesn't have a sink.It has a marble fireplace, which is a great mantlepiece for pictures/ alcohol etc. Lots of storage - huge shelves, big chest of drawers, big closet. It's really big for a grade 2, there's enough space for me to fit 2 chairs and a coffee table in front of the fireplace. It's also right next to the kitchen, laundry, 2 toilets, and 2 showers (shared amongst 3-5 people, so you never ever have to wait.)It's quite drafty sometimes because it's facing the road (also a privacy issue sometimes), but this also means there are huge bay windows which are nice when its sunny. Also just got the heating fixed, so its really warm in the winter!"

There's not much to add to what people have already written.The 2 huge windows are fantastic with lovely surroundings, bird song in the mornings and very low road noise. There's also loads of floor space, so it's great if you want to have a few friends over for dinner.Heating- previous occupants have said it's cold at night but I've found keeping the radiator on high keeps the room perfectly warm (even if the energy wastage is shameful). I'm quite aghast to hear that there have been \"juicy spider\" issues, as I have not come across any yet...(I'm nervous now). I can indeed vouch for the ladybird issue though - I had 200 this Michaelmas (yes, procrastination made me count them), which is fine if you're into nature but not so fine if you can't deal with them flying around your room while you sleep in November and slowly dying on your floor in January.One other downside, although quite clearly stated is that there is no sink/basin, which can be quite frustrating at times but having said that, the room is right next to the biggest and probably least busy kitchen in the house.This room is the perfect getaway from Cambridge's hecticness and great value for money (still at grade 3)."

There's good shelving and wardrobe space, though the desk could be bigger. A downside is that the room is North-facing, so the natural light comes in mostly in the last hour of daylight.Living in Blantyre does mean getting used to slightly longer journeys to lectures (/supos/Hall/library/Cindies) or just being 5 min late to everything. Apart from that, it's a lovely place to live - very homely. The common room is fab (with a TV!), there a loads of kitchens and the distance from Hall means that many people share cooking, and there are loads of baths. Clean, nice baths."

Relatively well-equipped, with a coffee table and easy chair that actually fit in the room. No basin, but this isn't a problem as two loos (one also has a suspiciously underused bathtub) are literally just outside the door, which is very convenient. One of the three kitchens of old East Court is also right downstairs. Also plenty of wall space for posters etc. The room faces out onto Parker street which means it isn't as quiet as the rooms on the other side of the building, but it's still not extremely noisy; personally have never had trouble sleeping, but might want to think about it only if you're a super light sleeper. Minor cons would include the wardrobe, which is annoyingly small for no apparent reason and kind of wobbly, and the small size of the fridge, though that goes for all of the building and there is actually a proper fridge in the kitchen.

        "Comment": "The most important thing to note about the ground floor of J is that it is very much a working corridor; the Housekeeper has her office in J2, the laundry is downstairs and so is the main housekeeping office. This has some clear benefits, such as being first in line for the laundry (if you wake up early), but it can also make the room a bit noisy - it's directly above the washing machines (though you filter this out quickly) and the housekeeping staff arrive earlier in the morning than the average (non-boatie) student wakes up. On the subject of noise, the walls with 1a and the corridor are thin enough to hear conversations (as well as coughing etc) clearly, but the wall with 3 is thick. This can mean that the room sometimes gets noisy at night. My solution is ear plugs, which can be purchased relatively cheaply and in bulk online.Sitting at the desk to type a review biases it, because J1b has one of the best views in college, directly across the paddock. This can mean though that during the day the sun is often in your eyes as you work (the room being South facing), although I have not found this to be a huge problem. In terms of being light at night, opening the wardrobe door to its fullest extent mitigates this.As previous occupants have said, the storage is very good - a large wardrobe, a chest of draws and four large shelves. There is also a desk with draws (one lockable, but no sign of the key), a low coffee table, a small bedside table, two chairs and a fridge. The room is not large (with Hostel's high ceilings, it is actually taller than it is wide), but not really tiny either. The loo and gyp opposite and showers downstairs are also convenient."

There is a big fireplace and molding all around the walls. It's also bigger than J1a and b for the same price. The biggest issue I've had with the room has been the lack of storage space - rather than a wardrobe, there are just some racks built in around the fireplace. Instead of a chest and drawers, there are two small cupboards, and two small sets of shelves. I found this a bit annoying, but I think it really depends how much stuff you have."

        "Comment": "My room in New Court this year is very spacious and well situated within college, and it's been really nice to have a separate bedroom and living room. However, it certainly has its downsides and I think when picking a room like this these are the most important to know about in order to balance this against the fact that this is an expensive room. Firstly, the windows are all single-glazed (and two of mine were broken during Term 1) so the rooms get very(!) cold. It's nice to have a kitchenette, but if you want to cook then the facilities won't be good enough - my room just has a standard microwave, and I've never used the college-provided kettle and toaster because both look like they're past their best. Therefore, this is definitely more of a room for someone who frequents hall. The space for hanging clothes is poor, but there is other storage space and shelves. I've been really lucky to have an en-suite for my second year, although the shower is pretty narrow and probably in need of refurbishment. Also, be aware that the bedrooms look right over the bus station, so it's not atypical to hear them throughout the night (as well as the sound of people coming back from clubs at 1am); and if you like it to be very quiet, that you are next to the Old Library where music practices and events are held that can be very noisy, and whilst that hasn't really bothered me, I can see how it may bug some people. It's also worth noting that I've had to spend a term with the constant sound of maintenance work being done, which is a possibility if you live here and they need to refurb parts of rooms. Overall, I have liked living here and think I made a good choice, but you just have to be aware if picking the room that it's in a very old building so it often needs repair (the heating has stopped working before and I've had to have freezing cold showers during Winter) and is prone to maintenance problems."

My main problem with the room is the very small window, which is tucked away in a kind of corner between a wall and a sloping ceiling, so the room doesn't get much natural light - it is fine if you keep the light on all the time though.The room is right next to the toilets and shower and the bigger gyp room on this floor, so that's handy! The top floor of T has two gyp rooms but they're much smaller than the ones on the floor below and can get messy pretty quickly. The shower is v good (better than floor below) and the kitchen has hobs and a combi oven, so pretty good facilities :)Overall, very nice room and staircase because it's just been renovated - it is a little worse than the other grade 3s in North Court because of the small window, but it's probably too nice to be a grade 2"

Sound from bus station minimal when windows are closed, some loud noises from the roof when particularly windy but rarely an issue. Being at the top, there's plenty of stair climbing but also most of your view is over the park behind the bus station rather than the station itself"

        "Comment": "Really decent sized room for a Grade 2. It's the smallest room in the staircase but has definitely been big enough for me this year, and just has a cosy feel to it. I've had two friends stay round and they both managed to sleep at the same time on the floor and reckoned they could have fit another friend in too! (Although a later friend who visited didn't understand how two people had managed to sleep on the floor as she thought there wasn't much space...)The desk is shorter than most people's, which might be a downside if you like to spread out papers when working, and the windows aren't that big and are in a really inconvenient place to reach (above the desk and side table so you have to lean over everything and struggle with the old fashioned window closing mechanism). The windows don't seem to let in all that much natural light so I normally have the main lights all on. The only good thing about the windows is that from most angles in the room, all you can see is the sky, so no one can really see in from the street if you don't draw your curtains.It faces onto the bus station so there is definitely street noise but that never bothered me much when trying to sleep (I'm quite a heavy sleeper and if I'm tired I'll just fall asleep immediately, but if you're a light sleeper you might want to go elsewhere). You can hear people talking/laughing in the neighbouring rooms, but I think the walls are reasonably thick so its not normally that bad.Temperature control in the room is great. Shower and toilet facilities are decent. For some reason, the top floor (where this room is) has a tiny toilet room and shower room. As you progress down the floors, the shower/sink rooms get bigger, so if it bothers you, you can just use the shower facilities downstairs which are nicer."

Big perk is the window seat facing onto parkers piece which lets in lots of light in the morning.\n\nIn general can be slightly dark just because the windows are quite small, but nothing too awful. No sink, but the kitchen and bathroom with shower and toilet) are on the floor below so not too far to walk.\n\nMajor downsides of this room are: when its windy it it is really noisy, all the pipes in the walls rattle as do some of the windows. Heating, generally really good but you have to regularly call maintenance to bleed the radiator (maybe once a term), not too much hassle but slightly annoying that sometimes it just stops working and then the room is freezing. Lots of stairs, you will get fit climbing the stairs up to this room (3 flights of stairs). Finally this house has NO Hobs :'(\n\nOn balance I love this room, spacious for the grade and nice and central in college, my favourite place I have lived over my 3 years and would really recommend it.\n\n"

The lack of view isn't too bad - being on the third floor, it gets some sunlight while also not looking into the offices next door. The problems are fairly minor - it doesn't have a lockable storage unit as some rooms do, so you can't really leave anything over the holidays, and also the mirror is small and a bit too high (I can only see from my shoulders up and for full-length view I have to open the wardrobe door all the way and stand on my chair on the opposite side of the room...).

Main bedroom is approximately the same square footage as a north court room, living room is ~50% bigger, pantry is larger enough one person to stand in (note that the ceiling does slope however).\n\nMain cons are that the heating is a bit erratic (you can get it to be warm enough but it takes a little fine tuning), the stairs are rather steep and winding, and the walls/floor are rather thin given the volume of parties in Old Court. The kitchen facilities are also somewhat limited (no hobs ;_;).\n\nOverall I can wholeheartedly recommend these rooms, and shall be very sad to move out at the end of this year."

That being said I really enjoy living in it, it’s immefiately next to the bathroom and the kitchen is a few steps away too.

The shower gets very hot and has decent water pressure. Old South is really central and close to the library, New South, Hostel and Front Court.\n\nDisadvantages: Due to orientation of the room, there's not as much sunlight in the evenings, the windows are not very well insulated (not sure how much better other rooms are), very thin walls and bad acoustic insulation, no thermostat, only two sockets at desk (with lamp and fridge), so would recommend to bring an extension lead. No hob in gyp and no way of ventilation because the gyp door is a fire door.\n\nOverall, would recommend for a curious nature, that doesn't cook or is up for the challenge (it is possible to make decent, fresh meals)."

Hasn't been a problem for me since the room next door has been empty this year but I can see how it might be a problem since I do sometimes hear a bit of noise from room 17. On the plus side, there is very little noise from the rest of the house but you are still conveniently near the common room.\nBlantyre isn't as bad as its reputation; it's really not that far and the arguably low number of showers has never actually been a  problem. Also, the kitchens have just been refurbished so are nice and new and have ovens as well as 4 hobs each!\nIf you're looking for a cheap but nice room which is really good value for money would very highly recommend this room!"

North facing so stays cool enough in summer but very dark in winter; small window and the light is not very bright. Desk chair is uncomfortable. No sink. Close to a good kitchen. On the side of the building with the laundry, more kitchens and more showers, but not near the common room. Obviously its Blantyre so a bit further from basically everything except for the chemistry department and sesame but its not too far - you get used to it. Overall its a perfectly adequate room and good value for the money."

It is not a renovated PT house which means it isn't as smart as some others but also means you can put stuff on the walls! It is not keycard access which means it's slightly less convenient than others (easier to get locked out; can't leave things in your room for people to collect etc...), but you can buzz people into you room if they enter via the front. \n\nLOVELY room - big and airy with two windows looking out over Parker's Piece, so the view is amazing. It's right next to the kitchen and is near (half a floor) to a bathroom too. A particular pro is that it has two really big cupboards so is good for storage. There are lots of potential combos for room layout.\n\nUnfortunately Park Terrace is a noisy road, with buses going along it frequently and occasional shouting people on Fridays and Saturdays. Also it is on the second floor.\n\nOverall really really nice though - and PT is so handy for both college/town and Grafton :)"

Desk looks out over the courtyard which is pretty, but you do hear the noise/buses from Emmanuel Street through the bedroom windows at night; blackouts have been fitted this year which block out the streetlights at least. New Court is best value for a grade 8 since they have en suites, but lack of cooking facilities is a drawback. Other options can be improvised, and you do get a microwave/kettle/toaster, but would be more ideal if you go to hall a lot. New Court is also good for the floor-to-ceiling cupboard which you can leave stuff in over the breaks- top cupboard can easily store 3 college-storage boxes + , the lower cupboard isn't as deep but can still fit plenty in. N4 specifically has nice high ceilings and gets good light/you have control over heating. However, the catering office is downstairs and is fairly busy/can be noisy at times, so can be distracting if you are in the room more working during the day.  "

The room is quite a nice space, and the upstairs corridor works really well with a group of friends. It has a fab shower/toilet to room ratio - two showers and a toilet are upstairs. The upstairs gyp is pretty nice, with newly installed hobs and a communal fridge - so you don't have to endure the rattle of the in-room fridge during the night. \nIt faces out onto Parker Street, but this hasn't bothered me at all - the room is still light enough but does not get too hot, and you can control the radiator anyway if it gets cold. It doesn't have a sink - but honestly this hasn't been an issue for any of us in the newly renovated rooms. We think that 21,22 and 23 all have pretty much the same floorspace, just different layouts. 22 has the nice bay window but thats the only difference.\nOverall, a fab choice if you are with friends and high enough in the ballot to nab it.

EC20 juts out of the building so it's a bit closer to Emmanuel Road than the other rooms . This is the road where all the national buses leave and there are also quite a few local buses and other vehicles driving past every day (and night). I eventually got pretty used to the noise and can sleep with earplugs but if you're very noise sensitive or need to work in your room (esp at rush hour!) this might not be the one for you! "

With the windows shut you get absolutely zero noise from outside and I'm a light sleeper. The toilet with basin is literally about 25cm from your door. Good wardrobe and chest of drawers, a decent amount of light if you fully open the curtains. The wind though the chimneys does make a little whooshing sound at night but I can't see it keeping anyone awake. Only drawback (and this applies to the entirety of north court) is that whilst the walls are pretty thick, the doors are not. If anyone is in the corridor, or clumping up the stairs, you hear them nice and clear. You can listen to conversations taking place 2 floors up in the corridor and basically hear every word.

Ever since this year the room has a completely new and beautiful desk, which has a large working space and big drawers. The windows aren't great and I would highly recommend stuffing paper between them as the rattling can get really annoying. Usually, if the heating is on full power it doesn't get too cold, but sometimes my curtains sway in the wind even if the windows are closed. The room is situated right above the common room, which can get a bit noisy sometimes, but it hasn't impacted me greatly. There is a beautiful kitchen right around the corner and four toilets and two baths. The showers are a bit further away, but I didn't mind it. Generally, it is a really nice room and living in Blantyre is actually great. I chose it because I was very low on the ballot, but now I live together with most of my friends and I enjoy having a proper kitchen so much (especially with many neighbours who bake as stress relief). It is also wonderful to have a common room and communal eating space. The bedders and especially Liz the housekeeper are all absolutely lovely and they keep the house so clean it's marvelous.

You also never need to lock your actual room as there is the main door into the flat that needs a key.

Plenty of light during the day from the windows - two smaller ones facing back into college, and one big one looking out onto Parkers Piece with a window seat (bigger than the rest of the PT attics I think). The windows are a bit draughty; the radiator works well so heat isn't an issue, but can be a little noisy when it's windy (nothing major though). A few things to note: firstly, the walls could do with repainting - not really an issue, they're just a bit scabby from previous people using blue tac. Secondly, it's a lot of stairs. It's 2 flights down to the bathroom, another to a small gyp, another to the ground floor (another bathroom), and then the kitchen is in the basement. Makes moving in a bit tricky (the highest stairs are steep and narrow) and the doorbell doesn't work (the house is key access), but it means you don't get any noise from the rest of the house, and the kitchen has a table and chairs so you can eat down there. Finally, the ceiling is very low - probably 6'2\" or 6'3\" at the highest points, but sloping on either side. Would certainly not recommend to anyone over 6 foot, and I (~5'10\") needed to move the furniture to the right place to avoid smacking my head on the sloped ceiling every time I got clothes out of the drawers etc. I haven't really found it to be a problem though.\nOverall the house is really nice. Showers are good, kitchen in the basement is really nice with 4 electric hobs and the table and chairs. Great room and cheap for PT - would definitely recommend (as long as you're not too tall)",

I picked it because I thought it would have nice light, but only about 2 hours in the afternoon are nice and light if it's sunny. The main drawback is that you can hear every conversation, music playing, laughing etc from the rooms on either side which can be quite frustrating even when your neighbours are lovely. On the other hand, there is absolutely no street noise. Also, there is no chest of drawers, which you notice immediately as an issue if you have quite a lot of clothes. Another issue (quite minor) is that all of the plug sockets are in really awkward/ inaccessible places in the room - I would recommend bringing an extension cable to combat this. That being said, this room is very cosy and my friends still seem to congregate in here even though it's the smallest of all our rooms. The sink is very handy, as is the storage space underneath it. Also, you won't be distracted looking out of your window because you see only garden and sky. You just have to be economical about how much you bring at the start of the year. You will be very close to showers, kitchens and toilets (4 of these about ten steps away) and there is always one free. A good way to save money and it is usually warm, but you have to be tidy to make it work.",

Lots of natural light because there are two windows - unfortunately it's still not very bright because this side of the building faces away from the Sun. There's noise from the street outside, so would not recommend for light sleepers. It's also very warm - I only used one out of the two radiators and felt adequately warmed even through the winter months. In all, it's not completely ideal but still a good value for the price and has become quite cosy and homely over time!",

        "Comment": "This room is a perfect size with a big window so lots of natural light. It has a lot of character with has some really nice features such as the window seat, mantlepiece and desk nook with the sloping roof. It is slightly inconvenient that the bed is not against a wall. As it's on the fourth floor there are a lot of stairs but you get used to them quickly!  The wind whistling through the mantlepiece grate is very audible and on a stormy night can keep you awake, but again, you get used to this. As with all North Court rooms, the doors are very thin and basically any noise on the staircase can be heard from inside the rooms loudly and clearly. The bathroom is just opposite so the lack of sink isn't a massive issue, but the door bangs very loudly every time it is opened which is annoying if you are a light sleeper - this might be something maintenance could look into. In my experience the bathroom is always busy as people come across from Q staircase to use it. There are no gyp rooms on R staircase, and the gyp room along the corridor on Q is tiny and rarely cleaned. But apart from these inconveniences, the room itself is exactly what you would expect from a grade 6 in North Court and a really lovely place to live. ",

It is ground floor which is good for getting your stuff in and out and is right next to 3 other rooms so is great if 4 friends want to live here. It is right next to the shared bathroom which is really convenient but does mean you get a bit more traffic outside of the room than other places. The worst thing is undoubtedly the view, which is essentially of a brick wall. There is little natural light so you will need the big light on at all times of the day.

I’ve maintenance-requested this a few times but they don’t seem to be able to fix it.  I don’t think the water actually is able to get to the top of the house.\nIssue #3 - you have a view of the library which is a massive guilt trip if you’re on your fourth episode of Friends of the day.\n\nOk the good stuff! When it’s raining (which is a lot of the time let’s face it bc it’s England) you hear all the raindrops on the roof which is lowkey a very exciting part of my daily routine.  Plus sloping ceilings are always fun!  The wardrobe is really pretty bc it’s lined with pink wallpaper.  Plus you have a great view of Parker’s Piece and you get a free lights show in Michaelmas bc of Winter Wonderland.  And the many stairs are great for your thighs!\n\n5/5 ⭐️",

The desk is a good size and has drawers as well and the windows are double glazed so don’t rattle in the wind. It’s a grade 1 so is very cheap but it is very small so if you want space pick a grade 2 or above in Blantyre. If you’re near the bottom of the ballot you’re probably going to have limited choice but actually it’s a really nice room and there’s the common room with the TV, a bathroom and shower nearby. ",

Great value for money and can look really aesthetic (except the curtains which are an ugly orange colour...) Cons would be that the sink often makes random noises and that the heating can’t be adjusted, so it is hard to regulate the temperature in the room.

There are blinds as well as curtains allowing you to black this out if you’re a day napper like me. The one down side to the windows is they don’t allow much temperature control. When the sun is out the room gets very hot but when it is cold it gets very cold. The radiator is right below the window so much of the heat is lost. \nOur beloved cat (really the neighbour’s but shh) really likes this room which is great assuming you like cats. If not his scratching at the door may become annoying but i’m sure he’ll eventually move on. \nDon’t live here if you are scared of ladybugs... they like it here a lot and in january you will become very familiar with the many varieties they come in. By February you will become very familiar w with their corpses as sadly they all die and you find them everywhere. \n\ngenerally blantyre house is a great place to live as it is not actually that far out but is cheap, has its own community, common room, laundry, baths and ovens! \n\nyou don’t have to be bottom of the ballot ",

        "Comment": "A fairly large room with ample space for storing everything you might need. Only T17 is next to the room, and even then there is solid walls and the width of the wardrobes and fire places taking up the shared wall space, which means you can pretty much play music etc. however loud you want. (Though T17 was unoccupied my year so I could be wrong, either way I benefited from this)\nThere is a gyp room literally 0.3m from your door which is great for making a coffee in the morning, and there is also a larger, more social gyp on the same floor. The gyps have proper combi-ovens with conventional oven settings, which to by surprise actually work for baking and making good food, they also already have kettles, toasters and good hobs, which is probably the best cooking facilities you can get as a first year.\nThere is one bathroom with a shower and toilet, one toilet only room and one shower room, all with sinks, between 8 rooms on the floor, rarely have to wait.\nThe landing and corridor is really large and sociable, often people from several floors will all come and sit together.\nThe window looks onto the alley-way between north court and the back of some shops which is not the most inspiring view however is probably better than the noisy bus station that many north court rooms look onto, because T staircase juts out on a corner, you can also see the front of one side of north court, which is actually quite nice architecture. \nOverall a very good room on a really sociable floor and staircase.",

        "Comment": "East Court is pretty good accomodation, it is a good location and nothing particularly wrong with the facilities.\n\nThis room is on the first floor and has a sink, the sink is one of its few redeeming features. It's on a staircase with the smallest gyp in the building, it is very small with barely space for two people to stand in, that being said the hob is alright and it had a combi oven, I did a lot of cooking and got on well, you just need to be a bit organised to find space to do things.\n\nThe room is also incredible small, the bed is extremely close to the desk (if having seperation between work space and personal space is important to you this is not a good room) The window is quite rattley and you will hear everyone coming and going through college via the east court gate, but has a nice view and can be opened fully. There isn't an actual wardrobe just a rail, this does provide slightly more hanging space but is over the fridge and chest of drawers which makes those harder to access. Because the room is small it was slightly lacking in storage space although this would not be an issue if you dont have as much junk as me.\n\nThere is easy access to the bathrooms in new east, and the showers are good, but I believe the bath in Old east is no longer there which is a shame.\n\nThere are much bigger and nicer grade threes available, but east court is a nice block and having a sink is a big bonus. I did find the room a bit claustrophobic however.",

        "Comment": "The room is fairly spacious though probably the smallest on this floor in new cloisters.  The floor space is pretty well structured but due to the shape I have found there are spaces which are quite impractical to use (the large space by the door). The en-suite is fairly spacious as college en-suites go. The room backs onto the back of North Court which is pretty noisy during the day with staff coming in and out of college - I have found I prefer not to work in here during the day for that reason, or use headphones to block out the noise. The room is fairly dark at points - there are big windows at one end but I have brought my own bedside lamp to light the other side of the room. The kitchens in New Cloisters are great - hobs that function well and a table that seats 4/5 people (the kitchen is shared between 7). Overall I'd recommend CL17 in terms of value for money - the noise and slightly odd shape are manageable and there is still plenty of space for the size of the room, especially with the good kitchen and the en-suite.

The pros are: extremely close to both bathrooms so is almost an ensuite; aesthetically nice inside; plenty of shelving space; plenty of furniture; and enough room to have ~5 friends over. The cons are: the view from the window is a brick wall and so in winter can get dark early; you can easily hear sounds from 2 floors up (though this is common to all of North Court), and S1's piano is against the adjacent wall to this room- this can be extremely annoying if your neighbour isn't considerate! You can hear the noises of the buses in the bus station, but it's quieter than on T staircase in this regard. ",

Really good if you are super sociable and want to host any gatherings in your room. Due to Covid, this benefit was lost on me though... But Warkworth houses lend themselves really well to house parties etc.!\n- Loads of natural sunlight coming in! This genuinely improved my mood when it was sunny - two huge windows to let all the light in. I had my desk right up against the window and I was SHINING in my Zoom supervisions. :\")\n- Tonnes of furniture. I have four (!) chairs, a coffee table and a bedside table. Good amount of storage space too, and tonnes of plug sockets everywhere.\n- The street is right next to a Tesco Express, the Grafton Centre, charity shops, Starbucks, Caffe Nero... You literally do not need to walk more than 5 minutes to get to all of these places. I barely went into the centre of town in Lent term lol.\n- Never had a noise complaint from neighbours; they seem lovely and we've never had any trouble with them.\n- The room is opposite the toilet and shower, so if you're lazy, you don't need to climb/go down any stairs lol. \n\nCons:\n- It is the coldest room in the house, probably because it's so big. We have had heating issues throughout the house anyway, and every time maintenance comes, it doesn't seem to get fixed uniformly throughout the whole house. But I have been absolutely freezing, to the point where I had to buy my own convection heater for the winter. Me and my poor circulation were dying </3\n- There are some brown bits of plaster on the ceiling that haven't been painted over yet, after some cracks developed this year that needed repairing. I don't know if College will paint it over soon, but it does look a bit... funky.\n- Honestly... Perhaps a bit too big... Or at least bigger than I really needed it to be. Move around all the furniture so it looks a bit more busy!\n",

        "Comment": "M3:6 is identical to rooms M3:7 through 10. The M3 corridor is on the first floor of New South Court, and is lift-accessible. It is a very fairly sized room, with more than enough desk, shelf, drawer and wardrobe space, and with enough floor space to pace around and keep yourself sane during self-isolation. The room gets really cold towards the end of Michaelmas, as do all the rooms in M3, but is also very warm during the summer so be sure to bring a fan to keep cool. The en-suite is great, although the shower takes some getting used to.  Fridge space in the room is limited, and the small freezer compartment does not work well, and the window opens a little to provide some fresh air.  The biggest issue in the room is internet connection - the wifi can be undependable at times, and the wired connection is hit-or-miss too (though be sure to bring an ethernet cable); this is entirely unhelpful in a year when all learning is online.  As an aside, there will be quite a bit of noise in the next couple of years as construction work is being done very nearby in college. Room 6 is right next to the kitchen, and while this is very useful, when people are chatting in there it can be quite distracting. The kitchen itself is great for socialising and has plenty of worktop space, although the induction hobs take quite a while to heat up.  Overall, the room is well worth the price and I'll definitely miss it next year",

The walls and rug are nice cosy colours, and the room just generally feels clean and welcoming. It has a fancy dresser and mantelpiece so you can dress it up a bit, and there's a lot of storage space (cupboards, shelves, wardrobe, chest of drawers).  Also has room for 6 people to sit on chairs or window seat. The small gyp is right next door which is super convenient, and there are lots of bathrooms on this floor (1 shower, 1 shower/toilet, 1 toilet). The view from the window is of a quiet little carpark, and you can also see all the way down the back side of North to new cloisters. There's direct sun in the early-mid afternoon. The downsides are pretty minor, but the main one is the way noise carries on the staircase - I think that's just how North works, and there are doors to block off this section of the corridor from the main bit and they really help! Also the plug sockets are all clustered together on one wall, but so long as you bring an extension cable you're sorted. Overall I don't think emma accommodation gets much better, especially considering how much you're getting for just a grade 4! 10/10 would recommend.",

        "Comment": "2nd floor. Nice 2 big windows facing Parker's so very light. Lots of storage. One of the smaller rooms in the house but that's because all the other rooms are huge. Nice mantelpiece. Blackout curtains although you will still get a bit of light in the mornings.\nNoise-wise you can hear parker's and the road but nothing earplugs can't solve. Good furniture. Bathroom and kitchen are one floor down. Not really accessible given it's on the 2nd floor. Overall unreal room for its grade.",

        "Comment": "Ahhh Blantyre, beautiful Blantyre. If you're here you're probably quite far down the ballot but worry not! If you've got a good group of friends you'll have a great time. During Covid where being in the middle of Cam hasn't been a huge priority (and most things have been online) it's been decent. Also, comfort yourself by knowing you'll have a great PT house in third year whilst your friends on Warkworth will be in North Court :))\n\nPros: Sink in room - useful. Grade 1 rent is very, very good value for a room in central Cambridge - can save up for a much nicer room next year. Kitchens are the best you'll get in any undergrad college accomodation - they're really, really good. Common room and dining area (we didn't really get to use them this year because of covid but I visited last year and they're great - we still used them for household dinners though and I used the fitness room as a workout room). Dampness and comfort of furnitute were fine. Nice view of the garden, and can use the window to get in and out of your room. You've got Tesco's/Co-op/Domino's/Sesame on the corner, are next to Mill Road, are 6 mins from the station, and are surrounded by other students (Caius/Downing/Pembroke second year accomodation all nearby). Finally, and most importantly, you're out of college - don't have to stress about porters/bumping into everyone/noise from bar/marquee/whatever and it's nice to have a bit more of a \"normal uni experience\" with much less of a boarding school vibe.\n\nCons: Difficult to sugarcoat this room - it's pretty small. Storage is better than expected, but it's still a bit of a shoebox. I spent 90% of my time in College/Cam e.g. I work in the library but if you spend a lot of your time in your room this might be an issue - there's a reason it's a grade 1 lol. If you have friends in e.g. Blantyre rooms 1, 2, or 3 then you can use their rooms to socialise - we had projectors and PS4s set up and we'd eat and relax there; however, it's difficult to host more than 4/5 people in Blan. 8. Area is pretty safe but if you're working late in the library walking back across Parker's can be a stress - most people cycle to college. Blantyre is also not very soundproof (think Old South levels) which might be a bit of an issue if you're not close with your immediate neighbours. Famously, it's a trek from college but I personally think it's really not that bad - 8 minutes door-to-door walk across Parker's and a 2-3 min cycle. I personally found that being outside of college and having that independence was worth it, but it's very personal. Funnily enough, most people who write Blantyre off as a 'trek' have never been there.\n\nIn sum - it's not what you would have picked but it'll end up being much nicer than you think. You'll hopefully save lots of money and if you have a good group of friends there you'll have a great time. Definitely recommend doing a tour of Blantyre first - so you can see what it's like and what each room is like before making your choice. Good luck :)",

        "Comment": "Room is fairly large although an awkward shape for if you are wanting to have more than 2 visitors! The lightning bolt description is very accurate but I find this is quite nice for work purposes as it creates different ‘zones’ of living (bed in one zone, desk in the other’. The en suite is great - very large mirror , and the shower is super powerful! Some issues with the toilet flushing at the beginning of the year but this has now been fixed by maintenance so should be good. Also, lots of cupboard space and shelving so good if you have a lot of stuff. The view is not incredible - it is currently a building site so there is a bit of noise in the mornings from the building works but this shouldn’t be a problem for future years. The room is always VERY warm too which is good in winter but in summer can make it extremely stuffy.",

        "Comment": "This room is sooo terrible - don't choose it if you can under any circumstances.\nThe room is directly next door to a school that have a loud dog that barks all day along. The school also do spray painting in the garden outside this room some afternoons so if you like the smell of paint in your room then choose this room. Directly opposite is another secondary school which means that while you are working there are screaming kids who can see directly into your room.\n\nTo make matters worse, the house has a terrible issue with piping which has meant that the entire ground floor smells of sewage and this can often be smelt in this room. The room is also directly above the newly installed boiler which makes a beeping noise all night long so for sure you will never be able to sleep.\n\nIf you want to never sleep, be harassed by school kids, and hear the barking of a crazy dog next door all day long then choose this awful room.",

        "Comment": "PROS: Your own door so you can walk straight into your room if you like. Right next to the gyp (which is v large, has a table, a moven, and two not-so-great hobs). There's a toilet in the basement which is rarely used by anyone else. There's a sink. It's relatively big overall, so nice if you like hosting. One shower in the house and it's quite big. \nCONS: Blue carpet + mint green walls + the ugliest yellow curtains = the 'before' look on QueerEye. Walls lowkey peeling away with pieces of wall paint (plaster?) chipping away, especially a larger bit under window on the right. No window that opens, only door onto street. Okay amount of light but it's still a basement. Radiator hasn't worked in months so if you get this room call maintenance ASAP.",
