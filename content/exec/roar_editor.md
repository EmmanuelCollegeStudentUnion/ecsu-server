## James

Hello! I’m James, a second year ASNaC, and I’m co-editor for ROAR alongside my father and long-standing email-writing colleague, Colin. 

My agenda for ROAR is very simple. Mostly it revolves around ducks, who I would argue are the most important part of Emmanuel College. I do have some other less important ideas, such as increasing the appeal of ROAR beyond the small group of the ROAR editor’s friends, which will be easy for me because of my lack of those. I’m excited for what Colin and I will achieve over this year, as long as ECSU doesn’t remove the position before then.

## Colin

I am a finalist studying archaeology. As this is not a real degree I have lots of free time to devote to ROAR. Some people say my election as co-ROAR editor is an sad attempt to fill the gaping void in my life after stepping down as ECSU VP, and they are absolutely right.  ROAR was the first thing I grasped hold of in a desperate attempt to give my life some meaning. It's a good thing I won the election, cause option 2 was crack.

My aims for ROAR this year are:

* More ducks, less ECSU ! (Lets face it, we're all more likely to go pet the ducks than go to an ECSU Committee meeting)
* Mercilessly rip off every feature that Whimper (first years - look it up) came up with
* Get out a ROAR every week. Even if it's shit.
