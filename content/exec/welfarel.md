Hey there! I’m Leoni and I’m in my second year studying Education. I’m a welfare officer alongside Damola here at Emma, and I’m excited to work with him to improve signposting for welfare services/contacts, at both a college and a university-wide level. On top of this, I aim to be a friendly face in college that people feel comfortable to approach.
