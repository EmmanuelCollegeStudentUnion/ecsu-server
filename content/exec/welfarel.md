Hey, Iâ€™m Shoshana and as the female/ non-binary welfare officer I will be working with Fabian to ensure students feel happy, healthy and safe at Emma! To help foster this kind of environment we will provide inclusive weekly events and offer individual support if you feel your welfare is suffering.
