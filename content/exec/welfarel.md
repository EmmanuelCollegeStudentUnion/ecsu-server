Hi, we’re Ted and Cli! As welfare officers, we’re here to help students feel welcome and happy at Emma. That means providing fun and inclusive events which encourage a sense of community. On an individual level, we’re here for anyone whose welfare is suffering and needs someone to talk to and to signpost the services available.
