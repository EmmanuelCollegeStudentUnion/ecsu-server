Hi we’re Eimear (2nd year studying history) and Sam (2nd year studying English), Emma’s 2019-20 Ents officers! We’re really looking forward to putting on some great events for everyone and keeping the social calendar busy. During our term/reign in ECSU we want to…

* Finally kickstart karaoke nights in Emma 
* Draw more music events to the bar (not forgetting DJ of the Week)
* Work with other colleges on more collaborative Super-ENTs
With Eimear’s networking prowess and Sam’s basic understanding of AUX cables there should be some good nights coming up. Let us know if there’s anything you want to see more of or even if you want to collaborate on an event and we’ll see what we can do! 

Ents love,

Eimear and Sam XX
