Hi! We're Seb and George your 2018-2019 Ents officers,

We're both 2nd year medical students and it's our job to organise and run college wide social events for the Emma undergraduates. This is quite a broad job and events range from plays and pub quizzes to whole college parties (sometimes even intercollege ones), also called Ents or Bops. We also work with the other officers on ECSU to set up any events that they might want to put on. 

Our day-to-day work mostly involves liasing with societies, musicians etc. and getting them to come and perform in Emma, along with setting up all the speakers and microphones for these and any other events that might be happening in Emma.

This year we're trying to acheive three main things: 

* Get a karaoke machine for college
* Do some more relaxed events such as pub quizzes
* Do more bops with other colleges

If you have any suggestions or would like us to help you put on you own event (even if you just want to put on some of your music in the bar one evening) don't hesitate to get in touch with us!

Ents love,

George and Seb xx
