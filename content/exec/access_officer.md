Hi, I’m Francesca (commonly known by Chez) and I’m one of your new Access & Class Act Officers. My goals are to create an inclusive and supportive ‘Access Community’ here at Emma, and to successfully organise the new ECSU BME shadowing scheme. I’m looking forward to Alex and I collaborating a lot with the rest of the (amazing) committee to bring about much needed change following on from the events of 2020!
