Hi I'm Tom, your Access Officer. My main set roles are coordinating the CUSU Shadowing, ECSU Shadowing and Access Bus schemes. Outside of this, I'm here to help out anyone who feels they are disadvantaged by being from a non-traditional Cambridge background. This can be for a multitude of reasons and I'm here for student welfare as well as lobbying college for policy changes.

I look forward to working with you
