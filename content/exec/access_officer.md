Hi, I’m Cara, a second year engineering student and Emma’s Access Officer!

My priorities for this year are to:
* Continue the success of outreach schemes such as Access Bus and the shadowing scheme
* Work towards making May Week more accessible
* Support students from access backgrounds within college.


Please feel free to contact me at access@ecsu.org.uk
