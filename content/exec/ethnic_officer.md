Hi I'm Ebenezer (he/him) and I'm the Racial Equalities Officer for this year. I'm looking forward to helping run the BME shadowing scheme, hosting some BME socials, and trying to get lots of the portraits of old white men replaced! I want Emma to be on open and inclusive community for BME students, so do get in touch if you have anything to discuss :))
