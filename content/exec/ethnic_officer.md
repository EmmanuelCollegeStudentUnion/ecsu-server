Hi, I’m Akshata, the Racial Equalities Officer this year! I’m so excited to work towards making Emma a more inclusive space. I look forward to holding some BME socials and working on the ECSU BME access shadowing scheme. Please reach out to me if you ever have any concerns or questions and I’ll try my best to help out, BME love <333
