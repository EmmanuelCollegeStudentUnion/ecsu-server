Hello all! My name is Hao Zhe (he/him), and I am a Materials Scientist in my third year (as of 2018/19 academic year).

As your BME Officer I seek to provide support and representation in ECSU policy making and raising any concerns BME individuals have. 

Please contact me at minorities@ecsu.org.uk for any concerns, criticisms and ideas or if you just want in to the super secret Emma EM page, where many exciting events are advertised!
