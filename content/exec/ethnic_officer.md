Hi! I'm Rio, a second-year Geography Student and I am excited to be your new Minorities officer! The main thing I want to achieve as part of my role is to improve the social events in Emma for minorities individuals alongside increasing links with other colleges. I'm also here to improve religious provisions and ensure that all minority individuals feel welcome by being approachable and voicing any concerns people have.
