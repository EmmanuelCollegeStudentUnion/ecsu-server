Hi! I’m Eliza (she/her), a Second Year English student.

My responsibilities as Buildings and Services Officer include liaising between catering staff and students (formal hall, regular hall and the vending machine), looking after sports equipment and the gym, anything relating to student accommodation and the bike maintenance equipment in Plodge.

This year I’m keen to try to achieve three main things:
* Make the process of sorting returning accommodation for intermitting students more transparent and inclusive
* Collaborate with Green Officer and President to develop a means of implementing a composting system across College
* Have College switch to Ecolabel cleaning products
