Hello, I'm Monty. I'm this year's Buildings and Services Officer. That means I'll be investigating ways we can improve the things college provides. I'm particularly keen to look into the balloting system and how we can improve the information we give freshers on how it all works. I'll be working closely with the President/VP and certain liberation officers to make sure we represent all members of college in any changes we make.
