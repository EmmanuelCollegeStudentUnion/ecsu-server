My name is Colin, I'm a 2nd year archaeologist and I'm passionate about access and environmental issues. I grew up in Scotland and attended a state comprehensive, so Cambridge has always seemed quite exotic and strange to me. In my spare time I like to run places and play guitar, occasionally at the same time. I am also a member of the Cambridge Assassin's Guild, but don't let this put you off getting in touch if you have any issues or comments on life at Emma !
