My name is Lucien and Iâ€™m a second year studying History and German.  I am very excited to be your Careers and Education officer, especially on such a great committee.  In this role I am looking forward to:
* Trying to broaden the horizons of careers and education at Emma by collaborating with MCR officers to offer a more holistic approach, offering more international advice on CVs and Cover letters and engaging more with University wide careers opportunities, and using the role to improve post-admissions access work.
* Increase engagement with Uni-wide careers opportunities, but also awareness of the educational support networks available, such as your faculty and schools reps. 
* Encourage a collaborative working environment.
