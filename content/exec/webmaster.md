Hi I'm James and I'm either the "Webmaster" or the "Communications and Publicity Officer" depending on whether you want the role to sound cool or be technically correct. My main job is running the ECSU website and maintaining the room database. With the communication part of the role I admin:

communications@ecsu.org.uk

and the anonymous feedback form:

https://www.ecsu.org.uk/feedback

so if you're ever unsure of which ECSU officer to email about something absolutely use this (we know there's a lot of us ðŸ˜ƒ). 

The above is an adjustment to to the last year's webmaster's bio because I'm making these changes as I update the site. Like this!
