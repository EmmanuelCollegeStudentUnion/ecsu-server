Hey, I'm Louis (he/him), I'm a second year studying HSPS, and I'm the LGBT+ officer! 

While in the role I hope to make sure Emma has an event-filled pride month, more LGBT+ specific welfare to create an inclusive and supportive environment for people from a range of different identities, and host a range of different LGBT+ socials that accommodate all students.
