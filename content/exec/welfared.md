Hi! I'm Fabian and I'm one of the new ECSU Welfare Officers, which means I'm here to make Emma feel like a warm, welcoming and positive environment for all. In terms of people's individual welfare concerns, I'm there for anyone to come to me if they need someone to talk to and signpost them to available services that offer further help. During the year I will be organising lots of fun, inclusive events, including both welfare staples like the chocolate fountain along with new events I'm aiming to introduce, like bringing back Welfare Walks. I'm excited to get stuck in and to meet more of you soon!
