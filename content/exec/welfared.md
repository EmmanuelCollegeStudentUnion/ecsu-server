Hi! My name’s Damola. I’m a first year BioNatSci. I am one of your two welfare officers; I work closely with Leoni to organise weekly welfare events in Emma. We plan to compile a document with clear and concise information on the different levels of welfare training given to college officials along with making the required college/university welfare contacts available to all students.

I hope to continue what is already a great welfare system and make Emma an even happier and friendlier place!

Feel free to approach me around college at any time, or email me.
