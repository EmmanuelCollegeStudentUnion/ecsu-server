I'm Victoria. I am a second year Law student.

My main priorities for this year are to:
* Put on some great fundraisers in college to support the charities that the student body votes on
* Promote new opportunities for Emma students to actively get involved and volunteer with Cambridge-wide charities
* Celebrate and support the great charity work done by students in college 

Please feel free to get in touch if you want to talk about your volunteering experiences, you have any great fundraising ideas or just want to chat about anything charities-related!
