Hi!! I’m Rosie (she/her) and I’m the charities officer for this year! I’m excited to support some really important charities! I can’t wait to run lots of different events both online and (hopefully) in person and to sell lots of charity stash! I also want to organise some volunteering opportunities once everyone is back in college and it’s safe to do so! I’m really looking forwards to the year ahead.
