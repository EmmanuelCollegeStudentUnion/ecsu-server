**Hi, I'm Meg and I'm your 2018-19 Disabilities Officer.** I'm a second year music undergraduate with a love for obscure medieval manuscripts, knitwear, and assorted teas. 

As your DSO, my priorities for this year will be:

**1)** continuing discussions with the college to improve and ensure accessibility both in current buildings and the New Development

**2)** provide support for those with disabilities going through the ballot system, exam season, and intermitting process

**3)** make 2019 Freshers week as accessible and manageable for students with disabilities as possible

If you'd like to discuss support available within college (anything from emotional to financial), manage supervision and exam allowances, or just need a listening ear and a cup of tea then please do email me.

Much, much love, 

Meg x
