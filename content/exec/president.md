Hello! I’m Charlotte (she/her) and I’m delighted to be serving as your ECSU President for 2021. In my role I head the Committee, represent the student body and provide a direct line to College. I’ll be using my position to ensure the Committee is fully supported in achieving their aims and that ECSU is a positive place and successful union for everyone. 

My aims as President include improving the ballot experience, reassessing certain living arrangements, improving College communications and enacting small but impactful changes to student life that will make Emma an even better place. 

Never hesitate to get in contact via president@ecsu.org.uk !
