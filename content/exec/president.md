I'm Matilda (she/her), a second Classicist. 

My responsibilities as President including chairing the weekly meetings of the ECSU Executive, sitting on various committees (all the way from Governing Body to Library Committee) in college, and representing ECSU in forums like CUSU PresCon and Council. 

My priorities for this year are to:

- fight for the right of every Emma student to feel happy, healthy and safe at college

- foster an environment of collaboration between the ECSU executive and its members, as well as between the executive and other unions across Cambridge.

- work to modernise and revitalise ECSU's digital output

I am a point of contact for all students, so please if you have any concerns email me.
