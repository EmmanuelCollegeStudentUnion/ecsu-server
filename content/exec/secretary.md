My name’s Meg Webb, I’m a third year music undergraduate, and looking forward to my second year as an ECSU Officer, this time as Secretary. I love novelty socks, the ducks on Paddock, a good pint of cider, and having a clear email inbox. I hope to continue working with the new Disabilities Officer to improve outreach and accessibility of information, and increase interaction between the ECSU officers and the student body via social media and other physical means within college.
