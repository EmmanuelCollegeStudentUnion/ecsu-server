Hi! I’m Michael (he/him), and I’m a second year mathmo. I’m excited to work with all our brilliant college societies and ECSU initiatives to secure funding so that they can keep running in the current climate. I’m also looking forward to working with local businesses in Cambridge over the next year and maintaining our relationship with Cambridge Crepes. I want to be totally fair and approachable so feel free to contact me with any questions!
