Hey! I'm Ben, as treasurer my main task is to keep up funding channels between college and societies. Outside of that is to maintain existing deals with local businesess and hopefully in conjunction with other JCRs set up new ones. Ideally I'd also like to work with the Green Officer to investigate more sustainable college banking options. Hopefully I'll run into you at somepoint if you have any questions otherwise feel free to contact me through email :)
