Hi, I'm Bridie (she/her) and I am so grateful to be your new Women's and Non-Binary Officer! I hope that this year I can work alongside the other liberation officers to create a more inclusive and empathetic community across college and within Emma's FemSoc. I can't wait to work alongside the rest of the amazing ECSU team and continue Cath's already transformative work regarding Emma's harassment and sexual misconduct policies. I'm really looking forward to getting started and supporting such a wonderful community!
