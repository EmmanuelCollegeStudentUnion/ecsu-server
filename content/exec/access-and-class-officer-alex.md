Hi! I'm Ann and I'm a second year HisPol student. Aside from continuing the work of the Access Bus and other Shadowing Schemes previously established by other Access Officers, one of my goals include trying to make the Emma Access community a more 'social' one. From more social events and trying to bring to life the 'Access week' for future freshers.
