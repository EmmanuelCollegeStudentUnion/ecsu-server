  A second year Archaeologists describes studying Archaeology at Emmanuel
  College, Cambridge
---
Hey, My name is Colin and I'm a second year archaeologist at Emmanuel College. Originally from the south of Scotland, I went to a state comprehensive before applying to study Archaeology at Cambridge. Here's my experience so far. 

**Studying Archaeology at a Cambridge College**

Studying archaeology is much like studying any other subject at Cambridge; there are the same general features such as supervisions ( 8 per term on average), lectures and set-work. However, archaeology differs from many other subjects in that the Tripos falls exactly between the sciences, humanities and arts spheres. Depending on your interests you could spend three years ( the length of a B.A.) studying inorganic chemistry, osteology, sociology or medieval manuscripts. You could even become a linguist and study ancient Egyptian or Akkadian. Archaeologists therefore benefit from an extremely broad Tripos (course) which allows you to train in many different disciplines. Other distinctive feature of the archaeological tripos are the high numbers of trips out of Cambridge (two in first year and two in second year) and requirement to do exciting work in the field ( one month in third year). If you love finding out about new cultures and travelling the globe, archaeology is the course for you ! 

**My experience studying Archaeology at Emmanuel**

Personally I have leant towards the pure 'archaeology' track in the Tripos (Akkadian, Egyptian, Biological Anthropology and joint tracks also exist). Out of the 4 modules students can chose for themselves across first and second year (2 modules in each) I have studied ancient Mesoamerica and the prehistory of Europe, but also the evolution of humans and a multi-discipline unit on philosophy, anthropology, archaeology and biological anthropology. I've really loved the modular nature of the course, which has allowed me to study subjects which are of special interest to me. The workload averages to about one essay a week (with an associated supervision) but this is often distributed unevenly across term, meaning you have a busy start and end of term, but a relaxed period in the middle. Coursework makes up a part of your final grade for most first and second year modules, and I really enjoyed doing my own research for these projects. 

**What are the perks of studying Archaeology at Emmanuel College, Cambridge?**

On a practical note the department is extremely close, meaning that if you are a fan of a lie in you can be at your lectures within 5 minutes. Additionally the Emmanuel College Library is well stocked with the standard archaeological texts for first year especially, and the main archaeological library (the Haddon) is also just down the road, saving you hunting for books across the university's many libraries. Emmanuel also has a good range of funds available to help undergraduates pay for fieldwork and fieldtrip expenses, information on which can be found here: https://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/welfare/financial/ . The department and college are very willing to help students financially with costs that are a part of their course. Emmanuel generally has one or two places for archaeology students ( this varies per year) so you will have someone to share you love of Iron Age pictograms with as well! Of course, in addition to these subject specific perks, Emmanuel is also a wonderful, welcoming community in its own right, with free laundry for students, massive green spaces on campus, good food and a reputation as one of the friendliest colleges in Cambridge.
