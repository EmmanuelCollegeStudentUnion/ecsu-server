Hope you’re all doing well in these most stressful of times. Please take care of yourselves.

For those of you who are in quarantine, have not been able to go home, or are staying in college, have a look at the welfare and support resources put together by Leoni and Damola (which you can find above). There’s also this document which was made by CUSU LGBT+ and contains loads of things to do, watch, bake etc… https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBee8JjeliCHep5jCsvrYdsedfKsGKKD7MuKCstb5Xc/edit

Also, remember that tutors remain available if you have any concerns. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your own tutor, you can contact any and all of them. 

If you are still trying to get home - here is the UK Government travel advice: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus

If you are unsure whether your country will let you in, you can contact embassies. Some of them are organising to repatriate citizens and they generally let you know if and how you can get home: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk - it’s under the London Diplomatic List.

Tier 4 sponsorship will continue for students who are working away, and in these exceptional circumstances will also continue during intermission for up to 4 months, with the possibility of extension. Updated visas and immigration information for students can be found at https://www.cam.ac.uk/coronavirus/visas-and-immigration
