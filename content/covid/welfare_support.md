The Welfare Officers, Leoni and Damola, have created this incredible drive with a plethora of resources to keep you smiling over the coming months - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-mP7l5f-9xVLYi0cpDet21zojOXA8b86


Your wellbeing is of great importance over the next few months, so we will try our best to provide light-hearted fun as well as sincere support when it is appropriate. Suggestions on how we can best improve the Google Drive are welcome too! If we all come together to support one another, then the Emma community spirit will still be strong, despite the physical distance between us.
