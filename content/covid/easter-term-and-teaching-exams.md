Unfortunately, there will be no face-to-face teaching or exams in Cambridge in Easter Term. All teaching will move online, and the University will communicate with all students about alternative assessment arrangements by **Tuesday, 31st March**. 

As a studentsâ€™ union, we will campaign for fairer arrangements that do not disadvantage disabled and international students, or those students experiencing difficult home environments, variable access to work tools and spaces, and demands placed upon them by the pandemic.

## Concerns about assessment

If you have concerns about alternative forms of assessment, we encourage you to get in contact with your **DoS and Tutor** to express these as soon as you can.  You can also contact your **Schools or Faculty students reps**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yR-respMVQrAoJfwV9Z09HWTCq2DM8T8SX1wRqVTnRQ/edit?usp=sharing

## Note-sharing Drives: ECSU and CUSU

We will all be facing challenges when preparing for assessment, especially now since university and college libraries are closed.  To help with this both ECSU and CUSU have created note-sharing drives on Google: 

* If you wish to be added to the **university-wide** note-sharing drive please email education@cusu.ac.uk or message Ali Cusu (the CUSU Education officer on Facebook). 
  * N.B. you will need a Google Account for this.  
* A number of **subject specific** note-sharing drives, provided by Emma college parents, can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yk4FnQnRvB2WNNJuddUM-c84ArtHPe7P. 
  * Your Subject parents will, hopefully, have already sent you these.
