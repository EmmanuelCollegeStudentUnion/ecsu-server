## If there are issues around being allowed to stay in college

College are approaching things on a case by case basis so **it is really important that you get into contact with your tutor** and ensure that they are informed about your individual situation so that college can see that your circumstances are 'exceptional' and mean that you need to stay in college. This is the route that you should all take, particularly in appealing the initial response or decision from the Bursar. 

ECSU are following CUSU's guidelines about who should be able to stay in college and understand that this is also broadly the approach that college are taking; please read this post so you have a realistic idea of whether college will be able to accommodate you: https://www.facebook.com/CUSUonline/posts/10156714154776916

If you feel that you are having problems with being allowed to stay, CUSU may also be able to offer support. Contact the Student Union Advice Service as they may be able to offer support on an individual basis. Email advice@studentadvice.cam.ac.uk

Additionally, fill out this form so that CUSU know that we need more support in Emma: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWQjTqyUoj7yTk2FHXlNnKFuO8svVjA6vNcYlqNmMDozZZvg/viewform
