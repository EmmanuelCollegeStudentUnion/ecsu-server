### Health advice
 
Stay at home if you have either:
a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Use the 111 online coronavirus service at https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/ to find out what to do. Staying at home advice is available at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-advice/.
 
We have a collective responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus, particularly to those most vulnerable. Protect yourself from novel coronavirus by:
* washing your hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds
* using hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available
* avoiding close contact with people who have symptoms of coronavirus
* only travelling on public transport if you need to
* working from home, if you can
* avoiding social activities, such as going to pubs, restaurants, theatres and cinemas
* avoiding events with large groups of people
 
The NHS will contact you from Monday 23 March if you are at particularly high risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus. You'll be given specific advice about what to do.
 
### Travel advice
 
The University’s travel advice can be found at https://www.cam.ac.uk/coronavirus/travel.
 
Many countries and territories have introduced screening measures (temperature checks, health/travel questions, quarantine) and entry restrictions at border crossings and transport hubs. If you decide to travel, contact the local immigration authorities or the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country you’re travelling to.  UK Government travel advice during this period is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus.
 
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) has also produced general advice on preparing for foreign travel and how everyone can reduce the spread of respiratory viruses at https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/499/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice-for-travellers.
