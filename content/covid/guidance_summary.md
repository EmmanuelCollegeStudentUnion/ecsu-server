## What you need to do

The UK Government introduced three measures on 23rd March:

* Requiring people to stay at home, except for very limited purposes.
* Closing non-essential shops and community spaces.
* Stopping all gatherings of more than two people in public.

Everyone must comply with these new measures. The relevant authorities, including the police, will be given the powers to enforce them – including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

## Health advice

Do not leave home if you have either:

* a **high temperature** – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
* a **new, continuous cough** – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)

Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. 

Use the 111 online coronavirus service at https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/ to find out what to do. Staying at home advice is available at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-advice/.

We have a collective (and legal) responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus, particularly to those most vulnerable. Protect yourself and others from novel coronavirus by:

* washing your hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds
* avoiding close contact with people who have symptoms of coronavirus
* **staying at home**, except for very limited exceptions
* protecting extremely vulnerable people by [shielding](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19)

## Foreign travel advice

The University’s travel advice can be found at https://www.cam.ac.uk/coronavirus/travel.

Many countries and territories have introduced screening measures (temperature checks, health/travel questions, quarantine) and entry restrictions at border crossings and transport hubs. If you decide to travel, contact the local immigration authorities or the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country you’re travelling to. UK Government travel advice during this period is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus.

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) has also produced general advice on preparing for foreign travel and how everyone can reduce the spread of respiratory viruses at https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/499/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice-for-travellers.
