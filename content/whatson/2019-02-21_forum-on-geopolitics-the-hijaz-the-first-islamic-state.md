As part of its Engelsberg Programme on Applied History, and together with the Cambridge Middle East and North Africa Forum, the Forum on Geopolitics is pleased to present this launch of Professor Malik Dahlan's latest book, The Hijaz: The First Islamic State. Dahlan offers an alternative vision of Islamic governance through the history and promise of the Hijaz, the first state of Islam. The Hijaz, in the west of present-day Saudi Arabia, was the first Islamic state in Mecca and Medina. This new interpretative history offers a fresh vision of Islamic governance and law as a positive force for political reform in the Middle East and beyond
