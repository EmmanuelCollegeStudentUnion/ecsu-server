**Talk description** (hosted by MENAF):

As China continues its global development strategy, the Belt and Road Initiative, its economic and political presence in the Middle East is growing. Yet, as the superpower delves deeper into the world's most fraught and complex region, questions arise regarding the impact this will have on the 'alternative diplomacy' it has favoured throughout the post-World War era. Join us on the 14th November as our panel of guests from across the political and academic fields consider China's emergence as a significant player in the Middle East, and the consequences for both its western counterparts, and the region itself.
