Labyrinth facilitator Kay Barrett will bring her cloth labyrinth for mindful walking in the Old Library. The labyrinth design has been outlined with painted pebbles, recalling peaceful times by the sea. The labyrinth has a single winding path which always leads to the centre. Unlike a maze, there are no tricks or dead ends.

Walking a labyrinth can help you let go of the thoughts of the busymind and open yourself to a sense of calm and an awareness that, fundamentally, everything is ok.

Kay will give a short introduction at 1.15, but you are welcome to come and go at any time between 1 and 4. Suggested latest arrival time 3.30 to allow enough time for walking.
