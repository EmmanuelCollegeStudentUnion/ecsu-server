Description: The mission of the inaugural Africans in STEM symposium is to highlight Africans conducting research in STEM fields and also any STEM research that is directly related to the African climate and market. The symposium will create an avenue for researchers to connect, share ideas and potentially form collaborations. It is primarily targeted at STEM researchers at all levels of expertise â€“ from undergraduate Part IIs to principal investigators. They strongly encourage young researchers, especially students, to present their work in the form of a poster and/or oral presentation at the symposium. Delegates who are interested in giving a presentation should submit their presentation title and abstract by Fri May 17. This can be done by following the links on their website, found here: https://www.africansinstem.co.uk/. Details of how to register for the symposium can also be found on the website. They welcome all to attend.
