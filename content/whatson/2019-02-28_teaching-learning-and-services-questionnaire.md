The Teaching, Learning and Services Questionnaire is now open. This survey is run by college so it can make improvements to the tutorial system, but response rate is about 10% at the moment. Take this opportunity to shape your tutorial system at Emma!

It is run by the College and is an excellent opportunity for you to give feedback and for the College to look into what it offers in more detail.

Please complete the questionnaire as fully as you can at http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/questionnaire
