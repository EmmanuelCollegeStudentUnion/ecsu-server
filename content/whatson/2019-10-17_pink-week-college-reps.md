Pink Week is looking for college reps, which is a fun and low commitment way to get involved! Reps mainly act as publicity for the week, sharing posts on facebook and around the college. They are also expected to organise 1-2 events in college, such as a formal or chapel collection. These events are crucial to the success of Pink Week, which last year raised over Â£40,000!
