This is a reminder to vote in the CUSU/GU elections (vote.cusu.cam.ac.uk). 

The elections are super contested this year so it would be great if turnout reflected that as students really can shape the future of CUSU and the priorities it has.

Votes close on the 8th!

Reminder that those eligible to vote for Disabled Students' Officer must self-define as disabled. Also, CUSU requests that voters in the Women's Officer election self-define as women or non-binary people.
