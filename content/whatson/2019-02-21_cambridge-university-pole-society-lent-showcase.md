This one night only event will showcase a range of pole dance performances from members of the Cambridge University Pole Society (CUPS). The society is dedicated to removing the stigma that surrounds pole dancing, and showing its true colours as an expressive, beautiful sport and dance style. As well as solo performances, the showcase will include group dances. This showcase will be a highly eclectic and impressive demonstration of the talents of the CUPS performers.
