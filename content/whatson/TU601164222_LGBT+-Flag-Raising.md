Location: Front Court

First used in San Francisco's civil rights marches, the rainbow (LGBT+) flag is the globally recognised symbol of pride, community, and the struggle for equal rights. ECSU are proud to fly the flag to mark the start of LGBT+ History Month and to celebrate Emma's inclusive community.
