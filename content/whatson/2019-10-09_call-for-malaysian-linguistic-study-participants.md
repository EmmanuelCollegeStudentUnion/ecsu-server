A student is looking for Malaysians (aged 18 years or above) to take part in a pilot study which investigates the use of English in Malaysia. It involves narrating a short animated film as well as completing a few computer-based linguistic tasks. The whole study lasts for around an hour, and it is based at the Faculty of English (CB3 9DP). Refreshments will be provided throughout the session.

If you are interested in taking part, please contact Samantha Sie at slws2@cam.ac.uk.
