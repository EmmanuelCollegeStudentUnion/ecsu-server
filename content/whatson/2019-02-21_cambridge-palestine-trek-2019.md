Do you want to visit Palestine this summer with other Cambridge students and experience the West Bank for yourself?

The Cambridge Palestine Trek 2019 is now open for applications!

Last year the Cambridge University PalTrek Society organised its inaugural trip to the West Bank. Organised solely by students for students, the trip aimed provide the unique opportunity for Cambridge students to visit the region for themselves: to experience and witness life in Palestine; to learn about the region's history and politics; and to undertake an unforgettable tour of this truly incredible part of the world. Over the course of a week, a group of 24 students visited religious, cultural and historic sites, refugee camps, natural wonders and local cultural festivals, and met with top NGOs, journalists, Palestinian and Israeli politicians, academics and ordinary Palestinians all across the West Bank.

This summer, the Palestine Trek is back with an expanded 10-day itinerary. The 2019 trip will be taking place in early-July (exact dates TBC). They hope to be able to offer the trip at a subsidised price, like last year, so that the trip is available to all.

If you're interested in joining this year's trip, they will be offering two further information sessions to give you the chance to meet the PalTrek's organisers and previous participants, learn more about the PalTrek, and ask any questions you might have. 

These sessions will take place on: **Tuesday 26th February** and **Friday 1st March** at 7:30pm in the Audit Room, King's College
