GCMB are looking for motivated and enthusiastic workers to help make the night a truly unforgettable experience!

They are specifically looking for SECOND SHIFT workers and CLEAN UP workers. The pay will be £42.50 for shift 2 workers (midnight to 06.00) and £31 for clean up workers (06.00-10.00).

The ball is on Tuesday 18th June, and the compulsory training day will be held on Saturday 8th June.

If you are interested, all you have to do is send a few bullet points about any previous experience you have had (whether at May Balls or not) to mayball-staffing@cai.cam.ac.uk, to help us work out which role you are most suited to. They still have positions available for DRINKS workers, GENERAL workers, HIT SQUAD members and ENTS runners.

The deadline for responses will be 31st May but please note positions will be allocated on a first come first serve basis, and could very likely fill up before then.
