As part of an MSc in Educational Research, this survey is looking in to the student experience of writing a personal statement and how this varies across different educational settings. Often advice about what universities expect from personal statements isn't that clear, so the research aims to understand . how students learn what needs to be included and what input they receive from different sources throughout the process.
