title: 'ECSU Careers Evening - 40 Years of Women at Emma'
---
Location: TBC

Officer: Careers and Education 

To celebrate the 40th Anniversary of women at Emma the Lent Term Careers event this year will involve an all female panel and we will have a key note speaker who will give a brief 5 minute speech during the drinks at the beginning. This is a great opportunity to get some excellent advice on career paths in general but also more specific advice on applications.

While the panel will be all female, this is of course open to everyone. There'll also be free drinks and snacks!!!
