_Where?_

This year Gotoco is offering 500 places on summer teaching programmes across all over China. Join them to assist with teaching projects in one of their 'real China' programmes in a typical Chinese city (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing or elsewhere) to learn about what is really happening in this exciting country. At the end of the programme they offer a free one week holiday to Yangshuo - our base in the mountains to the east of Vietnam, which is Lonely Planet's top-rated destination in the whole country!

Exact dates vary for each programme, they aim to be as flexible as possible to cater to the needs of their volunteers. They can offer various programme durations, anything from 2 weeks to 3 months.
