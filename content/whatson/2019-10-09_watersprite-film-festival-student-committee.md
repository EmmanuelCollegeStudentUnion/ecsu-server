Positions range from Events, Partnerships, and Communications & Marketing. You could be liaising with speakers to produce panel discussions or creating a social media storm to drive new audiences to the festival. Watersprite is currently in its eleventh year and last year we received over 1000 short film submissions from around 100 countries. They have had speakers such as Eddie Redmayne, Olivia Colman and David Yates deliver keynotes and are run by students from both University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University. If you're interested in being part of an open and student-focused festival with the opportunity to grow your film and television industry network and gain CV points, please apply to our teams! Details for each role are on their website and if you're not sure where you'd fit but want to get involved, please submit a general application. All details can be found here: https://www.watersprite.org.uk/join-us.

The deadline for applications is 15th October. For more information, please contact isobel.leigh@watersprite.org.uk.
