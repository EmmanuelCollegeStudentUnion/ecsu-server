Volunteers Needed: Brain Stimulation and Neuroimaging studies!

Adaptive Brain Lab are currently looking for participants aged 18-34 to take part in studies on visual perception and learning. If you would like to take part in either of the studies described below, or you would like more information, contact Lizzie: abgresearch@psychol.cam.ac.uk. Please use the subject heading “ENT_GPLEARN”. All studies take place in our lab in the Craik Marshall Building (Downing Site).

1)  	Brain stimulation: one 90 minute session, involving computer-based tasks and a brief period (~10 minutes) of intermittent brain stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a widely used method for non-invasive brain stimulation. You would be compensated at a rate of £8/hour.

2)  	EEG: up to 3 sessions of computer-based tasks. Sessions 1 & 3 last for up to 60 minutes (£8/hour). Session 2 would additionally involve a method for recording brain activity called EEG. The EEG equipment takes approximately one hour to prepare, so this session would last for ~2.5 hours. You would be compensated at a rate of £8/hour for all sessions.
