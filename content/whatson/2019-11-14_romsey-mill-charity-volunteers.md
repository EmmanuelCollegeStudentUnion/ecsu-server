Romsey Mill is a charity based within Cambridge and hopefully in the future Emma will be working closely with them. They work with children, young people and families who are facing a difficult time.

Check out the website and fb page: 

http://www.romseymill.org/ and https://www.facebook.com/romseymill/

If you are interested in volunteering, drop the Charities Officer an email (charities@ecsu.org.uk). You can give up as much or as little time as you like and it would be really good to get a group of volunteers together to make a difference for this great cause.
