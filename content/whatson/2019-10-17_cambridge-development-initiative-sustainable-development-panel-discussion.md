Sustainable Development: Leveraging the Small for Big Impact

'What can a small NGO do to generate sustainable impact in the development world?'

The Cambridge Development Initiative (CDI - www.cambridgedevelopment.org) are a student-run charity doing community-based development work in Tanzania. They are hosting an event so you can find out more about what they do, followed by a panel discussion on the topic of 'leveraging the small for big impact'.

Their diverse panel consists of both a mixture of development practitioners and development researchers. We hope their combined experience in the practice and theory behind international development will make for stimulating discussion on this topic and development practices in general.

This is a highly valuable event to learn about unique volunteering opportunities in Cambridge, and those interested in working for small NGOs in the future!

They are also opening recruitment for Executive Committee positions soon, namely: Deputy Director (External); Education Project Director; Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Director; and Treasurer. Details to follow.
