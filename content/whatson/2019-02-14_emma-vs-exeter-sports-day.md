**Agenda** (email fmr32@cam.ac.uk for any questions!)

Sport

* Feel free to sign up for multiple events! Go crazy

Transport

* We’ll be leaving by coach around 8:30, aiming to arrive in Oxford for 11:00. Depending on the numbers coming transport should cost between £12 and £15 (this price includes there and back). Please write either ‘Early’ or ‘Late’ depending on which coach you’d like to take back at the end of the day. The Early coach will leave after the swap (around 10pm) and the Late after the night out (around 2am).

Stash

* If you would like an Emma v Exeter shirt please indicate the size you would like: small, medium or large. It should cost around £5 (also dependent on numbers).

Swap

* Unfortunately due to arrangements at Exeter we won’t be able to attend formal there this year. We’re booking out a venue in Oxford for a swap to replace this. I’ve been given the impression by the Officer at Exeter they this is paid for individually on the day. I do need an idea of numbers though so please write ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ depending on whether you’d like to come to this. Spaces are limited to around 45 for this and will be allocated on a 'first come first served' basis. We'll hopefully be organising alternative evening activities in their college bar if numbers get beyond that.

Night out

* Please indicate whethet you’d like to come out after the Sports Day - when we have an idea of numbers we’ll hopefully be able to negotiate some drinks deals!
