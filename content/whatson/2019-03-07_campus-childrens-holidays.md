\* CAMPUS CHILDREN’S HOLIDAYS ARE NOW RECRUITING NEW HELPERS - PLEASE SIGN UP BY 18th MARCH \*

Campus Children’s Holidays is a charity run by Cambridge students and alumni which provides free respite holidays in Liverpool for children aged 6-13 who have been referred by social services, to give these children a break they sorely need. We are now recruiting new helpers for summer 2019.

Do you have a week between 20th July and 26th August to help provide disadvantaged children from Liverpool with a much-needed holiday? Do you want to run around like a child for a week, get your face painted, make new friends AND gain some invaluable new skills? Then sign up today to volunteer with Campus! We are currently looking for volunteers for our Residential project (8-13 year olds) and for our non-residential project; Hippo (6-8 year olds). It’s genuinely great fun and is so valuable to the children.
