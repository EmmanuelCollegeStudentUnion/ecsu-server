1584 Dinner (Halfway Hall) Bar Slideshow

\-----------2ND YEARS ONLY ------------           

Submissions are now open for the slideshow that will run in the bar after halfway hall. Use the link below to submit some nice photos of your friends from the last two years, be it shots from nights out, a screenshotted crushbridge, or just a blank background with a message for your mates. Maximum  file size is 10MB per file. The doc has an overall capacity of 1GB, if this is exceeded VP will just make another so go wild. For obvious reasons, please don't submit anything with very visible drug paraphernalia, nudity or otherwise offensive material. Photos of your mates intoxicated on the floor is fine, but remember that literally all of 2nd year will see these photos, so be considerate. If you have any concerns about the slideshow, send me an email at vicepresident@ecsu.org.uk.
