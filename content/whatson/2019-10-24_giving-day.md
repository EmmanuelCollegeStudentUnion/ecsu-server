In March 2020, Emmanuel is holding its first Giving Day at the College and the Development Office will need your help in several ways to make the Giving Day a success!

A ‘Giving Day’ is a really exciting 24 hour fundraising challenge that takes place mostly online. Ours is going to be dedicated to fundraising for Student Support so the funds raised will directly benefit you.

At the moment, the following roles are needed:

\- A film-making / video-editing enthusiast who can film and edit our campaign video(s). Even if you can only do one of these, get in touch! 

\- Anyone who has received financial support from College to do exciting and/or impactful charity work/ academic projects or internships / sports, arts or music who would be happy to write something short about it and/or talk about it in our campaign video(s).

\- At least 9 students to feature in a ‘thank you’ photo (by 7th November)

If you’re happy to help out in any of these areas - or have any questions - get in touch ASAP with Holly in the Development Office at hf349@emma.cam.ac.uk
