ECSU Committee has been working hard on updating our old constitution over the last year, and now we need YOU to come along and ratify it! The Open Meeting will be based around a series of amendments which will make some important changes to the constitution, affecting officer roles such as Shop and Roar.

The motions for the Open Meeting will be submitted at ECSU Committee this Sunday (JCR, 5.30pm). The old constitution will be posted to this event in due course: https://www.facebook.com/events/412079066382137/

Constitutionally a quorum (minimum number of voters) of **30** is required, so please do come along, especially if you are thinking of running for ECSU Committee in the upcoming elections! ECSU Officers will be there 15 minutes before the meeting starts if you would like to have a chat with them about their role on committee.

If you have any questions about the Open Meeting, email vicepresident@ecsu.org.uk 

Accessibility: The Queen's building JCR  is accessible by elevator. There are gender-neutral toilets in the basement. There is no hearing loop or sign-language interpreter.
